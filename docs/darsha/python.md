### Hello World
To print something to screen I need to use print command. Ex:
print  “sahand ranjbari”


### Print statements
To print something to screen I can use `print("sahand ranjbari")` in python 3.


### Strings
To print something to screen I need to use print “hello” and for combine we can use “ + “ Ex:
Print "hello" + " sahand ranjbari"

### handling errors
To correct the errors we have to use same quotes Ex: print (“ sahand ranjbari’)

### variables
You can write anything and = to any number Ex: sahand ranjbari = 5

### Arithmetic.
% baghi mande maloom nemishavad.

### Updating variables
Sogol += sahand  yani (sogol= sogol+ sahand)

### Comment
In alamat # dar computer khoonde nemishe vali vasaye badha ehtiaje.

### Numbers
Mesal ye khiar Mikhaim beklharim gheymate har khiar  3.25 ke mishe:
Khiar = 1 bad minevisim gheymate khiar = 3.25 va bad gheymate kolo mikhad ke mishe
Gheimate kol = khiar * gheymate har khiar bad gheymate kol ro mikhad print konim ke mishe
Print gheymate kol.

### Two type of division 
```python
Masalan age 4 / 2 konim baghimande nadir be in soorat minevisim khiar = 4 / 2
Vali agar ashari dar biad mesle 7 / 2 ke 3.5 mishe khiar = float (7) / 2
```

### Multi line string
```python
Dar zamani ke mikhaim ye chize toolani benevisim mesle ketab bayad az in alamat avale jomle va akhare jomle biarim “”” 3ta avale jomle va “”” 3 ta akhare jomle. masalan: “”” sogol mikhad darsesho tamoom kone”””
```

### Boolean
```python
Mitoonim har chizi o mosavie false or true gharar bedim masala: sogol is 12 years old = false or sogol is 30 years old = true
```

### Value error
```python
Age bekheim adade ashari ro round esh konim az in alamat estefade mikonim mesal: sogol = “7.5 “  mishe print int( sogol) va age bekhaim ashari bashe az in alamat estefade mikonim masalan sogol = “7.5” mishe :print float(sogol)
```

### Escaping character
```python
Vaghty minevisim 'There’s a snake in my boot!’ Vase inke dorost beshe bayad ye \ bezarim beinesh mesle: ’there\’s a snake in my boot’
 Access by index mesle: c= “cat”[0] or n= “Ryan”[3]
```
### String method

### Conditionals and control flow
```python
To Be and/or Not to Be
Boolean operators compare statements and result in boolean values. There are three boolean operators:

and, which checks if both the statements are True;
or, which checks if at least one of the statements is True;
not, which gives the opposite of the statement.![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nhqu9o5ku37wysm5jp3k.png)
not is evaluated first;
and is evaluated next;
or is evaluated last;
for example: True or not False and False returns True

Conditional Statement Syntax:

if is a conditional statement that executes some specified code after checking if its expression is True.

Here’s an example of if statement syntax:

if 8 < 9:
  print "Eight is less than nine!"
In this example, 8 < 9 is the checked expression and print "Eight is less than nine!" is the specified code.

Conditional Statement Syntax:

if is a conditional statement that executes some specified code after checking if its expression is True.

Here’s an example of if statement syntax:

if 8 < 9:
  print "Eight is less than nine!"
In this example, 8 < 9 is the checked expression and print "Eight is less than nine!" is the specified code. we should put 2 space before print.

Else Problems:

The else statement complements the if statement. An if/else pair says: “If this expression is true, run this indented code block; otherwise, run this code after the else statement.”

Unlike if, else doesn’t depend on an expression. For example:

if 8 > 9:
  print "I don't printed!"
else:
  print "I get printed!"

I Got 99 Problems, But a Switch Ain't One.


elif is short for “else if.” It means exactly what it sounds like: “otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this!”

if 8 > 9:
  print "I don't get printed!"
elif 8 < 9:
  print "I get printed!"
else:
  print "I also don't get printed!"
In the example above, the elif statement is only checked if the original if statement is False.

summary:

Comparators:

3 < 4
5 >= 5
10 == 10
12 != 13
Boolean operators:

True or False 
(3 < 4) and (5 >= 5)
this() and not that()
Conditional statements:

if this_might_be_true():
  print "This really is true."
elif that_might_be_true():
  print "That is true."
else:
  print "None of the above."

Your task is to complete the function by creating appropriate if and elif statements that will compare the input grade with a number and then return a letter grade.

Your function should return the following letter grades:

90 or higher should get an “A”
80 - 89 should get a “B”
70 - 79 should get a “C”
65 - 69 should get a “D”
Anything below a 65 should receive an “F”
```

### Complete the if and elif statements

```python
def grade_converter(grade):
    if (grade >= 90):
        return "A"
    elif (80 <= grade <= 89):
        return "B"
    elif ( 70 <= grade <= 79):
        return "C"
    elif (65 <= grade <= 69):
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"
      
# This should print an "A"      
print grade_converter(92)

# This should print a "C"
print grade_converter(70)

# This should print an "F"
print grade_converter(61)
```
### Pig Latin

### Practice Makes Perfect

#### problem

First, def a function called cube that takes an argument called number. Don’t forget the parentheses and the colon!

Make that function return the cube of that number (i.e. that number multiplied by itself and multiplied by itself once again).

Define a second function called by_three that takes an argument called number.

if that number is divisible by 3, by_three should call cube(number) and return its result. Otherwise, by_three should return False.

```python
def cube(n):
 return n * n * n

def by_three(n):
	if n % 3 == 0:
		return cube(n)
	else:
		return False
```
### Generic Imports
    
Did you see that? Python said: NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined. Python doesn’t know what square roots(jazr) are—yet.
There is a Python module named math that includes a number of useful variables and functions, and sqrt() is one of those functions. In order to access math, all you need is the import keyword. When you simply import a module this way, it’s called a generic import.

```python
import math
print math.sqrt(25)

Import the math module in whatever way you prefer. Call its sqrt function on the number 13689 and print that value to the console.
import math
print math.sqrt(13689)
```
### Function Imports

However, we only really needed the sqrt function, and it can be frustrating to have to keep typing math.sqrt().

It’s possible to import only certain variables or functions from a given module. Pulling in just a single function from a module is called a function import, and it’s done with the from keyword:
```python
from module import function
```
Now you can just type sqrt() to get the square root of a number—no more math.sqrt()!

### Universal Imports

What if we still want all of the variables and functions in a module but don’t want to have to constantly type math.?

Universal import can handle this for you. The syntax for this is:
```python
from module import * 
from math import *
```
### Max and min
```python
The max() function takes any number of arguments and returns the largest one. (“Largest” can have odd definitions here, so it’s best to use max() on integers and floats, where the results are straightforward, and not on other objects, like strings.)

For example, max(1,2,3) will return 3 (the largest number in the set of arguments).min() take smallest one.
```
### abs
```python
The abs() function returns the absolute value of the number it takes as an argument—that is, that number’s distance from 0 on an imagined number line. For instance, 3 and -3 both have the same absolute value: 3. The abs() function always returns a positive value, and unlike max() and min(), it only takes a single number.
absolute = abs(-42)
print absolute which is 42
```
### type
```python
Finally, the type() function returns the type of the data it receives as an argument. If you ask Python to do the following:

print type(42)
print type(4.2)
print type('spam')
Python will output:

<type 'int'>
<type 'float'>
<type 'str'>
```

First, def a function, shut_down, that takes one argument s. Don’t forget the parentheses or the colon!

Then, if the shut_down function receives an s equal to "yes", it should return "Shutting down"

Alternatively, elif s is equal to "no", then the function should return "Shutdown aborted".

Finally, if shut_down gets anything other than those inputs, the function should return "Sorry"
```python
def shut_down(s):
  if s == "yes":
    return "Shutting down"
  elif s == "no":
    return "Shutdown aborted"
  else:
    return "Sorry"
    # problem
    First, def a function called distance_from_zero, with one argument (choose any argument name you like).

If the type of the argument is either int or float, the function should return the absolute value of the function input.

Otherwise, the function should return "Nope"

def distance_from_zero(num):
  if type(num) == int or type(num) == float:
    return abs(num)
  else:
    return "Nope"
  ```
  ### Planning Your Trip
  

 When planning a vacation, it’s very important to know exactly how much you’re going to spend.

def wages(hours):
  ##### If I make $8.35/hour...
  return 8.35 * hours
The above example is just a refresher in how functions are defined.

Let’s use functions to calculate your trip’s costs.
##### problem

.
Define a function called hotel_cost with one argument nights as input.

The hotel costs $140 per night. So, the function hotel_cost should return 140 * nights.
```python
##### solve
def hotel_cost(nights):
  return 140 * nights
##### problem
Below your existing code, define a function called plane_ride_cost that takes a string, city, as input.

The function should return a different price depending on the location, similar to the code example above. Below are the valid destinations and their corresponding round-trip prices.

"Charlotte": 183
"Tampa": 220
"Pittsburgh": 222
"Los Angeles": 475

##### solve
def plane_ride_cost(city):
  if city == "Charlotte":
    return 183
  elif city == "Tampa":
    return 220
  elif city == "Pittsburgh":
    return 222
  elif city == "Los Angeles":
    return 475
  
```
### Transportation
##### problem
.
Below your existing code, define a function called rental_car_cost with an argument called days.

Calculate the cost of renting the car:

Every day you rent the car costs $40.
if you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total.
Alternatively (elif), if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
You cannot get both of the above discounts.
Return that cost.

Just like in the example above, this check becomes simpler if you make the 7-day check an if statement and the 3-day check an elif statement.
```python
##### solve
    def rental_car_cost(days):
  cost = days * 40
  if days >= 7:
    cost -= 50
  elif days >= 3:
    cost -= 20
  return cost
  ```
##### problem

Below your existing code, define a function called trip_cost that takes two parameters, city and days and returns the sum of calling the rental_car_cost(days), hotel_cost(days - 1), and plane_ride_cost(city) functions.

Notice that we changed the argument of hotel_costs() from nights to days - 1. Since we want trip-cost to only depend on two parameters, we have to convert the variable nights into days. If you are going to be staying somewhere, the number of nights you stay there is one less than the number of days you were there (imagine a weekend trip to visit family, you leave Saturday and return Sunday, so you visit for two days, but only stay for one night).
##### solve 
```python

  
def trip_cost(city, days):
  return rental_car_cost(days) + hotel_cost(days - 1) + plane_ride_cost(city)
  ```
  ##### problem 
  
   After your previous code, print out the trip_cost( to "Los Angeles" for 5 days with an extra 600 dollars of spending money.

Don’t forget the closing ) after passing in the 3 previous values!
##### solve
```python
print trip_cost("Los Angeles", 5, 600)
```
### Introduction to Lists
  ```python
 list_name = [item_1, item_2]
with the items in between brackets. A list can also be empty: empty_list = [].
zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "pig" ];
```
### Access by Index

You can access an individual item on the list by its index. An index is like an address that identifies the item’s place in the list. The index appears directly after the list name, in between brackets, like this: list_name[index].

List indices begin with 0, not 1! You access the first item in a list like this: list_name[0]. The second item in a list is at index 1: list_name[1]. Computer scientists love to start counting from zero.

##### problem
Write a statement that prints the result of adding the second and fourth items of the list. Make sure to access the list by index!
##### solve
```python
numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]

print "Adding the numbers at indices 0 and 2..."
print numbers[0] + numbers[2]
print "Adding the numbers at indices 1 and 3..."
# Your code here!
print numbers[1] + numbers[3]
```
### New Neighbors
```python
A list index behaves like any other variable name! It can be used to access as well as assign values.

You saw how to access a list index like this:

zoo_animals[0]
# Gets the value "pangolin"
You can see how assignment works on line 5:

zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"
# Changes "sloth" to "hyena"
```
##### problem

Write an assignment statement that will replace the item that currently holds the value "tiger" with another animal (as a string). It can be any animal you like.
##### solve 
```python
zoo_animals = ["pangolin", "cassowary", "sloth", "tiger"]
# Last night our zoo's sloth brutally attacked 
# the poor tiger and ate it whole.

# The ferocious sloth has been replaced by a friendly hyena.
zoo_animals[2] = "hyena"

# What shall fill the void left by our dear departed tiger?
# Your code here!
zoo_animals[3] = "elephent"
```
### Late Arrivals List Length 

```python
A list doesn’t have to have a fixed length. You can add items to the end of a list any time you like!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
letters.append('d')
print len(letters)
print letters
In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
Then, we add the string 'd' to the end of the letters list.
Next, we print out 4, the length of the letters list.
Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
```
##### problem
On lines 5, 6, and 7, append three more items to the suitcase list, just like the second line of the example above. (Maybe bring a bathing suit?)

Then, set list_length equal to the length of the suitcase list.
##### solve
```python
suitcase = [] 
suitcase.append("sunglasses")

# Your code here!
suitcase.append("book")
suitcase.append("pen")
suitcase.append("lipstick")

list_length = len(suitcase) # Set this to the length of suitcase

print "There are %d items in the suitcase." % (list_length)
print suitcase
```
### List Slicing
```python
Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list. Consider the following code:

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
slice = letters[1:3]
print slice
print letters
What is this code doing?

First, we create a list called letters.

Then, we take a subsection of the list and store it in the slice list. We do this by defining the indices we want to include after the name of the list: letters[1:3]. In Python, when we specify a portion of a list in this manner, we include the element with the first index, 1, but we exclude the element with the second index, 3.

Next, we print out slice, which will print ['b','c']. Remember, in Python indices always start at 0, so the 1 element is actually b.

Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], notice that we did not modify the original letters list.
```
##### problem
.
On line 7, create a list called middle containing only the two middle items from suitcase.

On line 10, create a list called last made up only of the last two items from suitcase.
##### solve

middle = suitcase[2:4]

# The last two items (index four and five)
last = suitcase[4:6] 
```
### Slicing Lists and Strings
 ```python
 my_list[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
my_list[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items
```
##### problem
Assign to dog a slice of animals from index 3 up until but not including index 6.
Assign to frog a slice of animals from index 6 until the end of the string.
##### solve
```python


animals = "catdogfrog"

# The first three characters of animals
cat = animals[:3]

# The fourth through sixth characters
dog = animals[3:6]

# From the seventh character to the end
frog = animals[6:]
```
 :3 yani az 1 ta 3 va 6: yani az 6 ta akhar
 ### Maintaining Order
 ```python
 animals = ["ant", "bat", "cat"]
print animals.index("bat")
First, we create a list called animals with three strings.
Then, we print the first index that contains the string "bat", which will print 1.
We can also insert items into a list.

animals.insert(1, "dog")
print animals
We insert "dog" at index 1, which moves everything down by 1.
We print out ["ant", "dog", "bat", "cat"]
```
##### problem

Use the .index(item) function to find the index of "duck". Assign that result to a variable called duck_index.

Then .insert(index, item) the string "cobra" at that index.
###### solve 
```python

animals = ["aardvark", "badger", "duck", "emu", "fennec fox"]
duck_index = animals.index("duck")# Use index() to find "duck"

# Your code here!
animals.insert(duck_index,"cobra")

print animals # Observe what prints after the insert operation
```
### For One and All
```python
If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop. If you’ve learned about for loops in JavaScript, pay close attention! They’re different in Python.

for variable in list_name:
  # Do stuff!
A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.

Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.
```
##### problem
Write a statement in the indented part of the for-loop that prints a number equal to 2 * number for every list item.
##### solve
```python
my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
  # Your code here
  print 2 * number
  ```
### More with for
```python
If your list is a jumbled mess, you may need to sort() it.

animals = ["cat", "ant", "bat"]
animals.sort()

for animal in animals:
  print animal
First, we create a list called animals with three strings. The strings are not in alphabetical order.
Then, we sort animals into alphabetical order. Note that .sort() modifies the list rather than returning a new list.
Then, for each item in animals, we print that item out as "ant", "bat", "cat" on their own line each.
```

### This Next Part is Key
```python
d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}
This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.
```
##### problem
```python
.
Print the values stored under the 'Sloth' and 'Burmese Python' keys. Accessing dictionary values by key is just like accessing list values by index:
```
##### solve
```python
residents = {'Puffin' : 104, 'Sloth' : 105, 'Burmese Python' : 106}

print residents['Puffin'] # Prints Puffin's room number

# Your code here!
print residents['Sloth']
print residents['Burmese Python']
```
### New Entries
```python
Like Lists, Dictionaries are mutable. This means they can be changed after they are created. One advantage of this is that we can add new key/value pairs to the dictionary after it is created like so:

dict_name[new_key] = new_value
An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of [] is an empty list.

The length len() of a dictionary is the number of key-value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, even if the value is a list. (That’s right: you can put lists inside dictionaries!)
```
##### problem
Add at least three more key-value pairs to the menu variable, with the dish name (as a "string") for the key and the price (a float or integer) as the value. Here’s an example:

py menu['Spam'] = 2.50
##### solve
```python
menu = {} # Empty dictionary
menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair
print menu['Chicken Alfredo']

menu['pizza'] = 10.50# Your code here: Add some dish-price pairs to menu!
menu['club burger'] = 15.00
menu['deviled egg'] = 8.00
```
### Changing Your Mind
```python
changed in many ways. Items can be removed from a dictionary with the del command:

del dict_name[key_name]
will remove the key key_name and its associated value from the dictionary.

A new value can be associated with a key by assigning a value to the key, like so:

dict_name[key] = new_value
```
##### problem

# A dictionary (or list) declaration may break across multiple lines

# Removing the 'Unicorn' entry. (Unicorns are incredibly expensive.)

### Remove a Few Things
```python
Sometimes you need to remove something from a list.

beatles = ["john","paul","george","ringo","stuart"]
beatles.remove("stuart")
print beatles
This code will print:

 ["john","paul","george","ringo"]
We create a list called beatles with 5 strings.
Then, we remove the first item from beatles that matches the string "stuart". Note that .remove(item) does not return anything.
Finally, we print out that list just to see that "stuart" was actually removed.
```

Remove 'dagger' from the list of items stored in the backpack variable.
```
##### solve
```python
backpack = ['xylophone', 'dagger', 'tent', 'bread loaf']
backpack.remove('dagger')
print backpack
```
### It is Dangerous to Go Alone Take This
```python
Let’s go over a few last notes about dictionaries

my_dict = {
  "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
  "cash": -4483,
  "luck": "good"
}
print my_dict["fish"][0]
In the example above, we created a dictionary that holds many types of values.
The key "fish" has a list, the key "cash" has an int, and the key "luck" has a string.
Finally, we print the letter "c". When we access a value in the dictionary like my_dict["fish"], we have direct access to that value (which happens to be a list). We can access the item at index 0 in the list stored by the key "fish".
```
##### problem
```python
Add a key to inventory called 'pocket'

Set the value of 'pocket' to be a list consisting of the strings 'seashell', 'strange berry', and 'lint'

.sort() the items in the list stored under the 'backpack' key

Then .remove('dagger') from the list of items stored under the 'backpack' key

Add 50 to the number stored under the 'gold' key
```
##### solve
```python
inventory = {
  'gold' : 500,
  'pouch' : ['flint', 'twine', 'gemstone'], # Assigned a new list to 'pouch' key
  'backpack' : ['xylophone','dagger', 'bedroll','bread loaf']
}

# Adding a key 'burlap bag' and assigning a list to it
inventory['burlap bag'] = ['apple', 'small ruby', 'three-toed sloth']

# Sorting the list found under the key 'pouch'
inventory['pouch'].sort() 

# Your code here
inventory['pocket'] = ['seashell', 'strange berry', 'lint']
inventory['backpack'].sort()
inventory['backpack'].remove('dagger')
inventory['gold'] = inventory['gold'] + 50
```
### BeFOR We Begin
```python
Before we begin our exercise, we should go over the Python for loop one more time. For now, we are only going to go over the for loop in terms of how it relates to lists and dictionaries. We’ll explain more cool for loop uses in later courses.

for loops allow us to iterate through all of the elements in a list from the left-most (or zeroth element) to the right-most element. A sample loop would be structured as follows:

a = ["List", "of", "some", "sort"]
for x in a: 
  # Do something for every x
This loop will run all of the code in the indented block under the for x in a: statement. The item in the list that is currently being evaluated will be x. So running the following:

for item in [1, 3, 21]: 
  print item
would print 1, then 3, and then 21. The variable between for and in can be set to any variable name (currently item), but you should be careful to avoid using the word list as a variable, since that’s a reserved word (that is, it means something special) in the Python language.
```
##### problem

Use a for loop to print out all of the elements in the list names.
##### solve
```python
names = ["Adam","Alex","Mariah","Martine","Columbus"]

for name in names:
  print name
  ```
  ### This is KEY
  ```python
  You can also use a for loop on a dictionary to loop through its keys with the following:

# A simple dictionary
d = {"foo" : "bar"}

for key in d: 
  print d[key]  # prints "bar" 
Note that dictionaries are unordered, meaning that any time you loop through a dictionary, you will go through every key, but you are not guaranteed to get them in any particular order.
```
##### problem

Use a for loop to go through the webster dictionary and print out all of the definitions.
##### solve
```python
webster = {
  "Aardvark" : "A star of a popular children's cartoon show.",
  "Baa" : "The sound a goat makes.",
  "Carpet": "Goes on the floor.",
  "Dab": "A small amount."
}

for d in webster:
  print webster[d] # Add your code below!
```
### Control Flow and Looping
```python

The blocks of code in a for loop can be as big or as small as they need to be.

While looping, you may want to perform different actions depending on the particular item in the list.

numbers = [1, 3, 4, 7]
for number in numbers: 
  if number > 6:
    print number
print "We printed 7."
In the above example, we create a list with 4 numbers in it.
Then we loop through the numbers list and store each item in the list in the variable number.
On each loop, if number is greater than 6, we print it out. So, we print 7.
Finally, we print out a sentence.
Make sure to keep track of your indentation or you may get confused!
```
##### problem

Like step 2 above, loop through each item in the list called a.

Like step 3 above, if the number is even, print it out. You can test if the item % 2 == 0 to help you out.
##### solve
```python
a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

for number in a:
  if number % 2 == 0:
    print number
```
### Lists PLUS Functions
```python
Functions can also take lists as inputs and perform various operations on those lists.

def count_small(numbers):
  total = 0
  for n in numbers:
    if n < 10:
      total = total + 1
  return total

lotto = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
small = count_small(lotto)
print small
In the above example, we define a function count_small that has one parameter, numbers.
We initialize a variable total that we can use in the for loop.
For each item n in numbers, if n is less than 10, we increment total.
After the for loop, we return total.
After the function definition, we create an array of numbers called lotto.
We call the count_small function, pass in lotto, and store the returned result in small.
Finally, we print out the returned result, which is 2 since only 4 and 8 are less than 10.
```
##### problem
Write a function that counts how many times the string "fizz" appears in a list.

Write a function called fizz_count that takes a list x as input.
Create a variable count to hold the ongoing count. Initialize it to zero.
for each item in x:, if that item is equal to the string "fizz" then increment the count variable.
After the loop, please return the count variable.
For example, fizz_count(["fizz","cat","fizz"]) should return 2.

##### solve
```python
# Write your function below!
def fizz_count(x):
  count = 0
  for item in x:
    if item == "fizz":
      count = count + 1
  return count
```
### Your Own Store

Okay—on to the core of our project.

Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of your very own Codecademy brand supermarket.

animal_counts = {
  "ant": 3,
  "bear": 6,
  "crow": 2
}
In the example above, we create a new dictionary called animal_counts with three entries. One of the entries has the key "ant" and the value 3.
##### problem
Create a new dictionary called prices using {} format like the example above.

Put these values in your prices dictionary, in between the {}: py "banana": 4, "apple": 2, "orange": 1.5, "pear": 3

Yeah, this place is really expensive. (Your supermarket subsidizes the zoo from the last course.)
##### solve
```python
prices = { "banana": 4, "apple": 2, "orange": 1.5, "pear": 3}
```
##### problem

Create a stock dictionary with the values below.

py "banana": 6, "apple": 0, "orange": 32, "pear": 15
##### solve
```python
prices = { "banana": 4, "apple": 2, "orange": 1.5, "pear": 3}
stock = { "banana": 6, "apple": 0, "orange": 32, "pear": 15}
```
##### Keeping Track of the Produce
```python
Now that you have all of your product info, you should print out all of your inventory information.

once  = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
twice = {'a': 2, 'b': 4}
for key in once:
  print "Once: %s" % once[key]
  print "Twice: %s" % twice[key]
In the above example, we create two dictionaries, once and twice, that have the same keys.
Because we know that they have the same keys, we can loop through one dictionary and print values from both once and twice.
```
##### problem 
1.
Loop through each key in prices.

Like the example above, for each key, print out the key along with its price and stock information.

Print the answer in EXACTLY the following format:

apple
price: 2
stock: 0
Like the example above, because you know that the prices and stock dictionary have the same keys, you can access the stock dictionary while you are looping through prices.

When you’re printing, make sure to use the syntax from the example above, with %s.
##### solve
```python
prices = {"banana": 4,"apple": 2,"orange": 1.5,"pear": 3}

stock = {"banana": 6, "apple": 0, "orange": 32, "pear": 15}

for food in prices:
  print food
  print "price: %s" % prices[food]
  print "stock: %s" % stock[food]
  ```
  ### Something of Value 
  
  For paperwork and accounting purposes, let’s record the total value of your inventory. It’s nice to know what we’re worth!
  
  ##### problem
  Let’s determine how much money you would make if you sold all of your food.

Create a variable called total and set it to zero.
Loop through the prices dictionary.
For each key in prices, multiply the number in prices by the number in stock. Print that value into the console and then add it to total.
Finally, outside your loop, print total.
##### solve 
```python
prices = {"banana": 4,"apple": 2,"orange": 1.5,"pear": 3}

stock = {"banana": 6, "apple": 0, "orange": 32, "pear": 15}

total = 0
for food in prices:
  print prices[food] * stock[food]
  total = total + prices[food] * stock[food]
print total
```
### Making a Purchase

```python
Good! Now you’re going to need to know how much you’re paying for all of the items on your grocery list.

def sum(numbers):
  total = 0
  for number in numbers:
    total += number
  return total

n = [1, 2, 5, 10, 13]
print sum(n)
In the above example, we first define a function called sum with a parameter numbers.
We initialize the variable total which we will use as our running sum.
For each number in the list, we add that number to the running sum total.
At the end of the function, we return the running sum.
After the function, we create, n, a list of numbers.
Finally, we call the sum(numbers) function with the variable n and print the result.
```
##### problem
Define a function compute_bill that takes one argument food as input.

In the function, create a variable total with an initial value of zero.

For each item in the food list, add the price of that item to total.

Finally, return the total.

Ignore whether or not the item you’re billing for is in stock.Note that your function should work for any food list.
##### solve
```python
shopping_list = ["banana", "orange", "apple"]

stock = {
  "banana": 6,
  "apple": 0,
  "orange": 32,
  "pear": 15
}
    
prices = {
  "banana": 4,
  "apple": 2,
  "orange": 1.5,
  "pear": 3
}

# Write your code below!
def compute_bill(food):
  total = 0
  for item in food:
    total = total + prices[item]
  return total
```
###### problem
Make the following changes to your compute_bill function:

While you loop through each item of food, only add the price of the item to total if the item’s stock count is greater than zero.

if the item is in stock and after you add the price to the total, subtract one from the item’s stock count.
##### solve
```python
shopping_list = ["banana", "orange", "apple"]

stock = {
  "banana": 6,
  "apple": 0,
  "orange": 32,
  "pear": 15
}
    
prices = {
  "banana": 4,
  "apple": 2,
  "orange": 1.5,
  "pear": 3
}

# Write your code below!
def compute_bill(food):
  total = 0
  for item in food:
    if stock[item] > 0:
      total += prices[item]
      stock[item] -= 1
  return total
  print compute_bill(shopping_list)
  ```
  ### Lesson Number One
  ```python
  Welcome to this “Challenge Course”. Until now we’ve been leading you by the hand and working on some short and relatively easy projects. This is a challenge so be ready. We have faith in you!

We’re going to switch it up a bit and allow you to be the teacher of your own class. Make a gradebook for all of your students.

animal = {
  "name": "Mr. Fluffles",
  "sounds": ["meow", "purr"]
}
print animal["name"]
The example above is just to remind you how to create a dictionary and then to access the item stored by the "name" key.
```
##### problem

Create three dictionaries: lloyd, alice, and tyler.

Give each dictionary the keys "name", "homework", "quizzes", and "tests".

Have the “name” key be the name of the student (that is, lloyd‘s name should be "Lloyd") and the other keys should be an empty list (We’ll fill in these lists soon!)

##### solve
```python
lloyd = {
  "name" : "Lloyd",
  "homework" : [],
  "quizzes" : [],
  "tests" : []
}

alice = {
  "name" : "Alice",
  "homework" : [],
  "quizzes" : [],
  "tests" : []
}

tyler = {
  "name" : "Tyler",
  "homework" : [],
  "quizzes" : [],
  "tests" : []
}
```
##### problem
Now fill out your lloyd dictionary with the appropriate scores. To save you some time, we’ve filled out the rest for you.

Homework: 90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0

Quizzes: 88.0, 40.0, 94.0

Test Scores: 75.0, 90.0

Make sure to include the decimal points so your grades are stored as floats! This will be important later.
##### solve
```python
lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0],
  "quizzes": [88.0, 40.0, 94.0],
  "tests": [75.0, 90.0]
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}
```
Put It Together
```python
Now lets put the three dictionaries in a list together.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
The above example is just a reminder on how to create a list. Afterwards, my_list contains 1, 2, and 3.
```
##### problem
Below your code, create a list called students that contains lloyd, alice, and tyler.
##### solve
```python
lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [],
  "quizzes": [],
  "tests": []
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}

students = [lloyd, alice, tyler]
```
### For the Record
```python
Excellent. Now you need a hard copy document with all of your students’ grades.

animal_sounds = {
  "cat": ["meow", "purr"],
  "dog": ["woof", "bark"],
  "fox": [],
}
print animal_sounds["cat"]
The example above is just to remind you how to create a dictionary and then to access the item stored by the "cat" key.
```
##### problem
for each student in your students list, print out that student‘s data, as follows:

print the student‘s name
print the student‘s homework
print the student‘s quizzes
print the student‘s tests
##### solve
```python
lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [],
  "quizzes": [],
  "tests": []
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}

students = [lloyd, alice, tyler]
for student in students:
  print student["name"]
  print student["homework"]
  print student["quizzes"]
  print student["tests"]
  ```
 ### It is Okay to be Average
 ```python
 When teaching a class, it’s important to take the students’ averages in order to assign grades.

5 / 2
# 2

5.0 / 2
# 2.5

float(5) / 2
# 2.5
The above example is a reminder of how division works in Python.

When you divide an integer by another integer, the result is always an integer (rounded down, if needed).
When you divide a float by an integer, the result is always a float.
To divide two integers and end up with a float, you must first use float() to convert one of the integers to a float.
```
##### problem

Write a function average that takes a list of numbers and returns the average.

Define a function called average that has one argument, numbers.
Inside that function, call the built-in sum() function with the numbers list as a parameter. Store the result in a variable called total.
Like the example above, use float() to convert total and store the result in total.
Divide total by the length of the numbers list. Use the built-in len() function to calculate that.
Return that result.
##### solve

```python
lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0],
  "quizzes": [88.0, 40.0, 94.0],
  "tests": [75.0, 90.0]
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}

# Add your function below!
def average(numbers):
  total = sum(numbers)
  total = float(total)
  return total / len(numbers)
  ```
  ### Just Weight and See
  ```python
  Great! Now we need to compute a student’s average using weighted averages.

cost = {
    "apples": [3.5, 2.4, 2.3],
    "bananas": [1.2, 1.8],
}

return 0.9 * average(cost["apples"]) + \
0.1 * average(cost["bananas"])
In the above example, we create a dictionary called cost that contains the costs of some fruit.
Then, we calculate the average cost of apples and the average cost of bananas. Since we like apples much more than we like bananas, we weight the average cost of apples by 90% and the average cost of bananas by 10%.
The \ character is a continuation character. The following line is considered a continuation of the current line.
```
##### problem

Write a function called get_average that takes a student dictionary (like lloyd, alice, or tyler) as input and returns his/her weighted average.

Define a function called get_average that takes one argument called student.
Make a variable homework that stores the average() of student["homework"].
Repeat the above step for “quizzes” and “tests”.
Multiply the 3 averages by their weights and return the sum of those three. Homework is 10%, quizzes are 30% and tests are 60%.
##### solve
```python
lloyd = {
  "name": "Lloyd",
  "homework": [90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0],
  "quizzes": [88.0, 40.0, 94.0],
  "tests": [75.0, 90.0]
}
alice = {
  "name": "Alice",
  "homework": [100.0, 92.0, 98.0, 100.0],
  "quizzes": [82.0, 83.0, 91.0],
  "tests": [89.0, 97.0]
}
tyler = {
  "name": "Tyler",
  "homework": [0.0, 87.0, 75.0, 22.0],
  "quizzes": [0.0, 75.0, 78.0],
  "tests": [100.0, 100.0]
}

# Add your function below!
def average(numbers):
  total = sum(numbers)
  total = float(total)
  return total / len(numbers)

def get_average(student):
  homework = average(student["homework"])
  quizzes = average(student["quizzes"])
  tests = average(student["tests"])
  
  total = homework *.1 + quizzes * .3 + tests * .6
  return total
  ```
  ##### problem
  Define a new function called get_letter_grade that has one argument called score. Expect score to be a number.

Inside your function, test score using a chain of if: / elif: / else: statements, like so:

If score is 90 or above: return "A"
Else if score is 80 or above: return "B"
Else if score is 70 or above: return "C"
Else if score is 60 or above: return "D"
Otherwise: return "F"
Finally, test your function!

Print the resulting letter grade with print. Call the get_letter_grade function and pass in get_average(lloyd).
##### solve
```python

# Add your function below!
def average(numbers):
  total = sum(numbers)
  total = float(total)
  return total/len(numbers)

def get_average(student):
  homework = average(student["homework"])
  quizzes = average(student["quizzes"])
  tests = average(student["tests"])
  return 0.1 * homework + 0.3 * quizzes + 0.6 * tests

def get_letter_grade(score):
  if score >= 90:
    return "A"
  elif score >=80:
    return "B"
  elif score >=70:
    return "C"
  elif score >=60:
    return "D"
  else:
    return "F"
  
print get_letter_grade(get_average(lloyd))
```
##### problem

Define a function called get_class_average that has one argument class_list. You can expect class_list to be a list containing your three students.

First, make an empty list called results.

For each student item in the class_list, calculate get_average(student) and then call results.append() with that result.

Finally, return the result of calling average() with results.
##### solve
```python

def get_class_average(class_list):
  results = []
  for student in class_list:
    student_avg = get_average(student)
    results.append(student_avg)
  return average(results)
  ```
  ##### problem
  Create a list called students and fill it with the three students, alice, lloyd, and tyler.
2.
Find the average grade of the class. Print this numerical grade to the terminal.
Stuck? Get a hint
3.
Finally, determine the letter grade for the class’s average and print it to the terminal.
##### solve 
```python
students = [lloyd, alice, tyler]

avg = get_class_average(students)
print(avg)
print(get_letter_grade(avg))
```
### List accessing
##### problem
Please add the code to print out the second element in the list.
##### solve
```python
n = [1, 3, 5]

# Add your code below
print n[1]
```
### List element modification
##### problem
On line 3, multiply the second element of the n list by 5

Overwrite the second element with that result.

Make sure to print the list when you are done!
##### solve
```python
n = [1, 3, 5]
# Do your multiplication here
n[1] = n[1] * 5
print n
```
### Appending to a list

##### problem
.
Append the number 4 to the end of the list n.
##### solve
```python
n = [1, 3, 5]
# Append the number 4 here
n.append(4)
print n
```
### Removing elements from lists
```python
This exercise will expand on ways to remove items from a list. You actually have a few options. For a list called n:

n.pop(index) will remove the item at index from the list and return it to you:

n = [1, 3, 5]
n.pop(1)
# Returns 3 (the item at index 1)
print n
# prints [1, 5]
n.remove(item) will remove the actual item if it finds it:

n.remove(1)
# Removes 1 from the list,
# NOT the item at index 1
print n
# prints [3, 5]
del(n[1]) is like .pop in that it will remove the item at the given index, but it won’t return it:

del(n[1])
# Doesn't return anything
print n
# prints [1, 5]
```
##### problem
Remove the first item from the list n using either .pop(), .remove(), or del.
##### solve
```python
n = [1, 3, 5]
# Remove the first item in the list here
del(n[0])
print n
```
### More than one argument

##### problem
.
Define a function called add_function that has 2 parameters x and y and adds them together.
##### solve
```python
m = 5
n = 13

def add_function(x, y):
  return x + y

print add_function(m, n)
```
### Strings in functions
##### problem

Write a function called string_function that takes in a string argument (s) and then returns that argument concatenated with the word 'world'. Don’t add a space before world!
##### solve
```python
n = "Hello"
# Your function here!
def string_function(s):
	return s + 'world'

print string_function(n)
```
### Using an element from a list in a function
```python
Passing a list to a function will store it in the argument (just like with a string or a number!)

def first_item(items):
  print items[0]

numbers = [2, 7, 9]
first_item(numbers)
In the example above, we define a function called first_item. It has one argument called items.
Inside the function, we print out the item stored at index zero of items.
After the function, we create a new list called numbers.
Finally, we call the first_item function with numbers as its argument, which prints out 2.
```
##### problem
Change line 2 so that list_function returns only the item stored in index one of x, rather than the entire x list.
##### solve
```python
def list_function(x):
  return x[1]

n = [3, 5, 7]
print list_function(n) 
```
### Modifying an element of a list in a function
```python
Modifying an element in a list in a function is the same as if you were just modifying an element of a list outside a function.

def double_first(n):
  n[0] = n[0] * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
double_first(numbers)
print numbers
We create a list called numbers.
We use the double_first function to modify that list.
Finally, we print out [2, 2, 3, 4]
When we pass a list to a function and modify that list, like in the double_first function above, we end up modifying the original list.
```
##### problem
Change list_function to:

Add 3 to the item at index 1 of the list.
Store the result back into index 1.
Return the list.
##### solve
```python
def list_function(x):
  x[1] = x[1] + 3
  return x

n = [3, 5, 7]
print list_function(n)
```
### List manipulation in functions
```python
You can also append or delete items of a list inside a function just as if you were manipulating the list outside a function.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print my_list
# prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
The example above is just a reminder of how to append items to a list.
```
### Printing out a list item by item in a function
This exercise will go over how to utilize every element in a list in a function. You can use the existing code to complete the exercise and see how running this operation inside a function isn’t much different from running this operation outside a function.

Don’t worry about the range function quite yet—we’ll explain it later in this section.
##### problem
Define a function called print_list that has one argument called x.

Inside that function, print out each element one by one. Use the existing code as a scaffold.

Then call your function with the argument n.
##### solve
```python
n = [3, 5, 7]

def print_list(x):
  for i in range(0, len(x)):
    print x[i]
    
print_list(n)
```
##### problem
.
Create a function called double_list that takes a single argument x (which will be a list) and multiplies each element by 2 and returns that list. Use the existing code as a scaffold.
##### solve
```python
n = [3, 5, 7]

def double_list(x):
  for i in range(0, len(x)):
    x[i] = x[i] * 2
  return x
# Don't forget to return your new list!

print double_list(n)
```
### Passing a range into a function
```python
Okay! Range time. The Python range() function is just a shortcut for generating a list, so you can use ranges in all the same places you can use lists.

range(6) # => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
range(1, 6) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
range(1, 6, 3) # => [1, 4]
The range function has three different versions:

range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)
In all cases, the range() function returns a list of numbers from start up to (but not including) stop. Each item increases by step.

If omitted, start defaults to 0 and step defaults to 1.
```
##### problem
On line 6, replace the ____ with a range() that returns a list containing [0, 1, 2].
##### solve
```python
def my_function(x):
  for i in range(0, len(x)):
    x[i] = x[i]
  return x

print my_function(range(3)) 
```
### Iterating over a list in a function
```python
Now that we’ve learned about range, we have two ways of iterating through a list.

Method 1 - for item in list:

for item in list:
  print item
Method 2 - iterate through indexes:

for i in range(len(list)):
  print list[i]
Method 1 is useful to loop through the list, but it’s not possible to modify the list this way.

Method 2 uses indexes to loop through the list, making it possible to also modify the list if needed. Since we aren’t modifying the list, feel free to use either one on this lesson!
```
##### problem
On line 3, define a function called total that accepts one argument called numbers. It will be a list.
Inside the function, create a variable called result and set it to zero.
Using one of the two methods above, iterate through the numbers list. For each number, add it to result.
Finally, return result.
###### solve
```python
n = [3, 5, 7]

def total(numbers):
  result = 0
  for i in range(0,len(numbers)):
    result += numbers[i]
  return result
```
### Using strings in lists in functions
```python
Now let’s try working with strings!

for item in list:
  print item

for i in range(len(list)):
  print list[i]
The example above is just a reminder of the two methods for iterating over a list.
```
##### problem
Create a function that concatenates strings.

Define a function called join_strings accepts an argument called words. It will be a list.
Inside the function, create a variable called result and set it to "", an empty string.
Iterate through the words list and concatenate each word to result.
Finally, return the result.
Don’t add spaces between the joined strings!
##### solve
```python
n = ["Michael", "Lieberman"]
# Add your function here

def join_strings(words):
  result = ""
  for word in words:
    result += word
  return result

print join_strings(n)
```
### Using two lists as two arguments in a function
```python
Using multiple lists in a function is no different from just using multiple arguments in a function!

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
print a + b
# prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
The example above is just a reminder of how to concatenate two lists.
```
##### problem
Create a function that joins two lists together.

On line 5, define a function called join_lists that has two arguments, x and y. They will both be lists.
Inside that function, return the result of concatenating x and y together.
##### solve
```python
m = [1, 2, 3]
n = [4, 5, 6]

def join_lists(x, y):
  return x + y

print join_lists(m, n)
# You want this to print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
### Using a list of lists in a function
```python
Finally, this exercise shows how to make use of a single list that contains multiple lists and how to use them in a function.

list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

for lst in list_of_lists:
  for item in lst:
    print item
In the example above, we first create a list containing two items, each of which is a list of numbers.
Then, we iterate through our outer list.
For each of the two inner lists (as lst), we iterate through the numbers (as item) and print them out.
We end up printing out:

1
2
3
4
5
6
```
##### problem
Create a function called flatten that takes a single list and concatenates all the sublists that are part of it into a single list.

On line 3, define a function called flatten with one argument called lists.
Make a new, empty list called results.
Iterate through lists. Call the looping variable numbers.
Iterate through numbers.
For each number, .append() it to results.
Finally, return results from your function.
##### solve
```python
n = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]


def flatten(lists):
  results = []
  for numbers in lists:
    for number in numbers:
      results.append(number)
  return results

print flatten(n)
```
### Getting Our Feet Wet

The first thing we need to do is to set up the game board.
##### problem

Create a variable board and set it equal to an empty list.
##### solve
```python
board = []
```
### Make a List
```python
Good! Now we’ll use a built-in Python function to generate our board, which we’ll make into a 5 x 5 grid of all "O"s, for “ocean.”

print ["O"] * 5
will print out ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'], which is the basis for a row of our board.

We’ll do this five times to make five rows. (Since we have to do this five times, it sounds like a loop might be in order.)
```
##### problem
Create a 5 x 5 grid initialized to all ‘O’s and store it in board.

Use range() to loop 5 times.
Inside the loop, .append() a list containing 5 "O"s to board, just like in the example above.
Note that these are capital letter “O” and not zeros.
##### solve
```python
board = []
for i in range(5):
  board.append(['O'] * 5)
  ```
### Check it Twice

Great job! Now that we’ve built our board, let’s show it off.

Throughout our game, we’ll want to print the game board so that the player can see which locations they have already guessed. Regularly printing the board will also help us debug our program.

The easiest way to print the board would be to have Python display it for us using the print command. Let’s give that a try and see what the results look like—is this a useful way to print our board for Battleship?
##### problem
Use the print command to display the contents of the board list.
##### solve
```python
board = []
for i in range(5):
  board.append(['O'] * 5)
  print board
  ```
  ### Custom Print
  Now we can see the contents of our list, but clearly it would be easier to play the game if we could print the board out like a grid with each row on its own line.

We can use the fact that our board is a list of lists to help us do this. Let’s set up a for loop to go through each of the elements in the outer list (each of which is a row of our board) and print them.
##### problem
First, delete your existing print statement.

Then, define a function named print_board with a single argument, board_in.

Inside the function, write a for loop to iterates through each row in board and print it to the screen.

Call your function with board to make sure it works.
##### solve
```python
board = []

for i in range(5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board_in):
  for row in board:
    print row
    
print_board(board)
```
 ### Printing Pretty
```python
We’re getting pretty close to a playable board, but wouldn’t it be nice to get rid of those quote marks and commas? We’re storing our data as a list, but the player doesn’t need to know that!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print " ".join(letters)
print "---".join(letters)
In the example above, we create a list called letters.
Then, we print a b c d. The .join method uses the string to combine the items in the list.
Finally, we print a---b---c---d. We are calling the .join function on the "---" string.
We want to turn each row into "O O O O O".
```
##### problem
Inside your function, inside your for loop, use " " as the separator to .join the elements of each row.
##### solve
```python
board = []

for i in range(5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board_in):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)
    
print_board(board)
```
### Hide
```python
Excellent! Now, let’s hide our battleship in a random location on the board.

Since we have a 2-dimensional list, we’ll use two variables to store the ship’s location, ship_row and ship_col.

from random import randint
coin = randint(0, 1)
dice = randint(1, 6)
In the above example, we first import the randint(low, high) function from the random module.
Then, we generate either zero or one and store it in coin.
Finally, we generate a number from one to six inclusive.
Let’s generate a random_row and random_col from zero to four!
```
##### problem
Define two new functions, random_row and random_col, that each take board_in as input.

These functions should return a random row index and a random column index from your board, respectively. Use randint(0, len(board_in) - 1).

Call each function on board.
##### solve
```python
from random import randint 

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

# Add your code below!

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)
    
def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

random_row(board)
random_col(board)
```
### and Seek
```python
Good job! For now, let’s store coordinates for the ship in the variables ship_row and ship_col. Now you have a hidden battleship in your ocean! Let’s write the code to allow the player to guess where it is.

number = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
if int(number) == 0:
  print "You entered 0"
raw_input asks the user for input and returns it as a string. But we’re going to want to use integers for our guesses! To do this, we’ll wrap the raw_inputs with int() to convert the string to an integer.
```
##### problem
.
Create a new variable called guess_row and set it to int(raw_input("Guess Row: ")).

Create a new variable called guess_col and set it to int(raw_input("Guess Col: ")).

Click Run and then answer the prompts by typing in a number and pressing Enter (or Return on some computers).
##### solve
```pyhon
from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0,5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)

# Add your code below!
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))
```
### You win
```python
Okay—now for the fun! We have the actual location of the ship and the player’s guess so we can check to see if the player guessed right.

For a guess to be right, guess_col should be equal to ship_col and guess_row should be equal to ship_row.

if guess_col == 0 and guess_row == 0:
  print "Top-left corner."
The example above is just a reminder about if statements.
```
##### problem
On line 29, add an if to check if guess_row equals ship_row and guess_col equals ship_col.

If that is the case, please print out "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"

When you run this code, be sure to enter integer guesses in the panel where it asks for “Guess Row” and then “Guess Col”.
##### solve
```python
from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

print ship_row
print ship_col

# Write your code below!
if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
  print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"
```
### Danger Will Robinson
Great! Of course, the player isn’t going to guess right all the time, so we also need to handle the case where the guess is wrong.

print board[2][3]
The example above prints out "O", the element in the 3rd row and 4th column.
##### problem
Add an else under the if we wrote in the previous step.

Print out "You missed my battleship!"

Set the list element at guess_row, guess_col to "X".

As the last line in your else statement, call print_board(board) again so you can see the "X".Make sure to enter a col and row that is on the board!
##### solve
```python
from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
print ship_row
print ship_col
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

# Write your code below!
if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
  print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"  
else:
  print "You missed my battleship!"
  board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
  print_board(board)
  ```
  ### Bad Aim
  ```python
  Great job! Now we can handle both correct and incorrect guesses from the user. But now let’s think a little bit more about the “miss” condition.

They can enter a guess that’s off the board.
They can guess a spot they’ve already guessed.
They can just miss the ship.
We’ll add these tests inside our else condition. Let’s build the first case now!

if x not in range(8) or \
   y not in range(3):
  print "Outside the range"
The example above checks if either x or y are outside those ranges. The \ character just continues the if statement onto the next line.
```
##### problem
Add a new if statement that is nested under the else.

Like the example above, it should check if guess_row is not in range(5) or guess_col is not in range(5).

If that is the case, print out "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."

After your new if statement, add an else that contains your existing handler for an incorrect guess. Don’t forget to indent the code!
##### solve
```python
from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
print ship_row
print ship_col
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

# Write your code below!
if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
  print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"   
else:
  if guess_row not in range(5) or \
    guess_col not in range(5):
    print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
  else:
    print "You missed my battleship!"
    board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
  print_board(board)
   ```
   ### Not Again
   Great! Now let’s handle the second type of incorrect guess: the player guesses a location that was already guessed. How will we know that a location was previously guessed?

print board[guess_row][guess_col]
The example above will print an 'X' if already guessed or an 'O' otherwise.
##### problem
Add an elif to see if the guessed location already has an ‘X’ in it.

If it has, print "You guessed that one already."
##### solve
```python
from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(0, 5):
  board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
  for row in board:
    print " ".join(row)

print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
  return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
  return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
print ship_row
print ship_col
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

# Write your code below!
if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
  print "Congratulations! You sank my battleship!"   
else:
  if guess_row not in range(5) or \
    guess_col not in range(5):
    print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
  elif (board[guess_row][guess_col] == 'X'):
    print "You guessed that one already."
  else:
    print "You missed my battleship!"
    board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
  print_board(board)
```
### Play It Sam
```python
You can successfully make one guess in Battleship! But we’d like our game to allow the player to make up to 4 guesses before they lose.

for turn in range(4):
  # Make a guess
  # Test that guess
We can use a for loop to iterate through a range. Each iteration will be a turn.
```
##### problem
Add a for loop that repeats the guessing and checking part of your game for 4 turns, like the example above.

At the beginning of each iteration, print "Turn", turn + 1 to let the player know what turn they are on.

Indent everything that should be repeated.
##### solve
```python
for turn in range(4):
  print "Turn", turn + 1
  guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row: "))
  guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col: "))

```
### Game Over
If someone runs out of guesses without winning right now, the game just exits. It would be nice to let them know why.

Since we only want this message to display if the user guesses wrong on their last turn, we need to think carefully about where to put it.

We’ll want to put it under the else that accounts for misses
We’ll want to print the message no matter what the cause of the miss
Since our turn variable starts at 0 and goes to 3, we will want to end the game when turn equals 3.
##### problem
Add an if statement that checks to see if the user is out of guesses.

Put it under the else that accounts for misses.
Put it after the if/elif/else statements that check for the reason the player missed. We want "Game Over" to print regardless of the reason.
If turn equals 3, print "Game Over".
##### solve
```python
  if guess_row not in range(5) or \
      guess_col not in range(5):
      print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
    elif board[guess_row][guess_col] == "X":
      print( "You guessed that one already." )
    else:
      print "You missed my battleship!"
      board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
    if (turn == 3):
      print "Game Over"
    print_board(board)
  ```
   ### While loop 
   The while loop is similar to an if statement: it executes the code inside of it if some condition is true. The difference is that the while loop will continue to execute as long as the condition is true. In other words, instead of executing if something is true, it executes while that thing is true.

Line 6 decides when the loop will be executed. So, “as long as count is less than 5,” the loop will continue to execute. Line 8 increases count by 1. This happens over and over until count equals 5.
##### problem
Change the loop so that it counts from 0 up to 9 (inclusive).

Be careful not to alter or remove the count += 1 statement. If your program has no way to increase count, your loop could go on forever and become an infinite loop which could crash your computer/browser!
##### solve
```python
count = 0

if count < 5:
  print "Hello, I am an if statement and count is", count

while count < 10:
  print "Hello, I am a while and count is", count
  count += 1
  ```
  ### Condition
  The condition is the expression that decides whether the loop is going to continue being executed or not. There are 5 steps to this program:

The loop_condition variable is set to True
The while loop checks to see if loop_condition is True. It is, so the loop is entered.
The print statement is executed.
The variable loop_condition is set to False.
The while loop again checks to see if loop_condition is True. It is not, so the loop is not executed a second time.
```python
loop_condition = True

while loop_condition:
  print "I am a loop"
  loop_condition = False
  ```
   
##### problem
Create a while loop that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 squared (1, 4, 9, 16, … , 100), each on their own line.

Fill in the blank space so that our while loop goes from 1 to 10 inclusive.
Inside the loop, print the value of num squared. The syntax for squaring a number is num ** 2.
Increment num.
##### solve
```python
num = 1

while num <= 10:  # Fill in the condition
  # Print num squared
  print num ** 2
  # Increment num (make sure to do this!)
  num += 1
  ```
### Simple errors
A common application of a while loop is to check user input to see if it is valid. For example, if you ask the user to enter y or n and they instead enter 7, then you should re-prompt them for input.
##### problem
.
Fill in the loop condition so the user will be prompted for a choice over and over while choice does not equal 'y' and choice does not equal 'n'.
##### solve
```python
choice = raw_input('Enjoying the course? (y/n)')

while choice != 'y' and choice != 'n':  # Fill in the condition (before the colon)
  choice = raw_input("Sorry, I didn't catch that. Enter again: ")
  ```
!= this is mean does not equal.
### Infinite loops
```python
An infinite loop is a loop that never exits. This can happen for a few reasons:

The loop condition cannot possibly be false (e.g. while 1 != 2)
The logic of the loop prevents the loop condition from becoming false.
Example:

count = 10
while count > 0:
  count += 1 # Instead of count -= 1
  ```
  ##### problem
  The loop in the editor has two problems: it’s missing a colon (a syntax error) and count is never incremented (logical error). The latter will result in an infinite loop, so be sure to fix both before running!
  ##### solve
  ```python
  count = 0

while count < 10: # Add a colon
  print count
  count += 1
  # Increment count
  ```
  ### Break
  The break is a one-line statement that means “exit the current loop.” An alternate way to make our counting loop exit and stop executing is with the break statement.

First, create a while with a condition that is always true. The simplest way is shown.
Using an if statement, you define the stopping condition. Inside the if, you write break, meaning “exit the loop.”
The difference here is that this loop is guaranteed to run at least once.
```python
count = 0

while True:
  print count
  count += 1
  if count >= 10:
    break
```
### While else
Something completely different about Python is the while/else construction. while/else is similar to if/else, but there is a difference: the else block will execute anytime the loop condition is evaluated to False. This means that it will execute if the loop is never entered or if the loop exits normally. If the loop exits as the result of a break, the else will not be executed.

In this example, the loop will break if a 5 is generated, and the else will not execute. Otherwise, after 3 numbers are generated, the loop condition will become false and the else will execute.
```python
import random

print "Lucky Numbers! 3 numbers will be generated."
print "If one of them is a '5', you lose!"

count = 0
while count < 3:
  num = random.randint(1, 6)
  print num
  if num == 5:
    print "Sorry, you lose!"
    break
  count += 1
else:
  print "You win!"
  ```
### Your own while else
```python
Now you should be able to make a game similar to the one in the last exercise. The code from the last exercise is below:

count = 0
while count < 3:
  num = random.randint(1, 6)
  print num
  if num == 5:
    print "Sorry, you lose!"
    break
  count += 1
else:
  print "You win!"
In this exercise, allow the user to guess what the number is 3 times.

guess = int(raw_input("Your guess: "))
Remember, raw_input turns user input into a string, so we use int() to make it a number again.
```
##### problem

Use a while loop to let the user keep guessing so long as guesses_left is greater than zero.

Ask the user for their guess, just like the second example above.

If they guess correctly, print "You win!" and break.

Decrement guesses_left by one.

Use an else: case after your while loop to print "You lose.".
##### solve
```python
from random import randint

# Generates a number from 1 through 10 inclusive
random_number = randint(1, 10)

guesses_left = 3
# Start your game!
while guesses_left > 0:
  guess = int(raw_input("Your guess: "))
  if guess == random_number:
    print "You win!"
    break
  guesses_left -= 1
else:
  print "You lose."
  ```
### For your health
An alternative way to loop is the for loop. The syntax is as shown in the code editor. This example means “for each number i in the range 0 - 9, print i“.
##### problem
Make the loop print the numbers from 0 to 19 instead of 0 to 9.
##### solve
```python
print "Counting..."

for i in range(20):
  print i
```
### For your hobbies
##### problem
Create a for loop that prompts the user for a hobby 3 times.

Save the result of each prompt in a hobby variable

append each one to hobbies.

print hobbies after your for loop

Make sure to answer the prompts in the terminal when testing your code!
##### solve
```python
hobbies = []

# Add your code below!

for num in range(3):
  hobby =  raw_input("Tell me one of your favorite hobbies: ")
  hobbies.append(hobby)

print hobbies
```
### For your strings
Using a for loop, you can print out each individual character in a string.

The example in the editor is almost plain English: “for each character c in thing, print c“.
##### problem 
Add a second for loop so that each character in word is printed one at a time.
##### solve
```python
thing = "spam!"

for c in thing:
  print c

word = "eggs!"

# Your code here!
for character in word:
  print character
  ```
### For your A
```python
String manipulation is useful in for loops if you want to modify some content in a string.

word = "Marble"
for char in word:
  print char,
The example above iterates through each character in word and, in the end, prints out M a r b l e.

The , character after our print statement means that our next print statement keeps printing on the same line.
```
##### problem
Let’s filter out the letter "A" from our string.

Do the following for each character in the phrase.
If char is an "A" or char is an "a", print "X", instead of char. Make sure to include the trailing comma.
Otherwise (else:), please print char, with the trailing comma.
##### solve
```python
phrase = "A bird in the hand..."

# Add your for loop
for char in phrase:
  if char == "A" or char == 'a':
    print 'X',
  else:
    print char,
  ```
  ##### problem
  .
Write a second for loop that goes through the numbers list and prints each element squared, each on its own line.
##### solve
```python
numbers  = [7, 9, 12, 54, 99]

print "This list contains: "

for num in numbers:
  print num

# Add your loop below!
for num in numbers:
  print num ** 2
  ```
  ### Looping over a dictionary
  ```python
  You may be wondering how looping over a dictionary would work. Would you get the key or the value?

The short answer is: you get the key which you can use to get the value.

d = {'x': 9, 'y': 10, 'z': 20}
for key in d:
  if d[key] == 10:
    print "This dictionary has the value 10!"
First, we create a dictionary with strings as the keys and numbers as the values.
Then, we iterate through the dictionary, each time storing the key in key.
Next, we check if that key’s value is equal to 10.
If so, we print "This dictionary has the value 10!"
```
##### problem
On line 5, print the key, followed by a space, followed by the value associated with that key.
##### solve
```python
d = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry'}

for key in d:
  # Your code here!
  print key, d[key]
  ```
  ### Counting as you go
  A weakness of using this for-each style of iteration is that you don’t know the index of the thing you’re looking at. Generally this isn’t an issue, but at times it is useful to know how far into the list you are. Thankfully the built-in enumerate function helps with this.

enumerate works by supplying a corresponding index to each element in the list that you pass it. Each time you go through the loop, index will be one greater, and item will be the next item in the sequence. It’s very similar to using a normal for loop with a list, except this gives us an easy way to count how many items we’ve seen so far.
##### problem
We don’t want the user to see things listed from index 0, since this looks unnatural. Instead, the items should appear to start at index 1. Modify the print statement to reflect this behavior. See the Hint for help.
##### solve
```python
choices = ['pizza', 'pasta', 'salad', 'nachos']

print 'Your choices are:'
for index, item in enumerate(choices):
  print index, item
  print index + 1
  ```
  ### Multiple lists
  It’s also common to need to iterate over two lists at once. This is where the built-in zip function comes in handy.

zip will create pairs of elements when passed two lists, and will stop at the end of the shorter list.

zip can handle three or more lists as well!
##### problem
Compare each pair of elements and print the larger of the two.
##### solve
```python
list_a = [3, 9, 17, 15, 19]
list_b = [2, 4, 8, 10, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

for a, b in zip(list_a, list_b):
  # Add your code here!
  print max(a, b)
  ```
### is_even
##### problem
.
Define a function is_even that will take a number x as input.

If x is even, then return True.

Otherwise, return False.
##### solve
```python
def is_even(x):
  if x % 2 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False
  
print is_even(5)
print is_even(6)
```
### is_int
An integer is just a number without a decimal part (for instance, -17, 0, and 42 are all integers, but 98.6 is not).

For the purpose of this lesson, we’ll also say that a number with a decimal part that is all 0s is also an integer, such as 7.0.

This means that, for this lesson, you can’t just test the input to see if it’s of type int.

If the difference between a number and that same number rounded is greater than zero, what does that say about that particular number?
##### problem
```python
Define a function is_int that takes a number x as an input.

Have it return True if the number is an integer (as defined above) and False otherwise.

For example:

is_int(7.0)   # True    
is_int(7.5)   # False    
is_int(-1)    # True      
```
##### solve
```python
def is_int(x):
  absolute = abs(x)
  rounded = round(absolute)
  return absolute - rounded == 0

print is_int(10)
print is_int(10.5)
```
### digit_sum
Write a function called digit_sum that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all that number’s digits. For example: digit_sum(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)
##### solve
```python
def digit_sum(n):
  total = 0
  string_n = str(n)
  for char in string_n:
    total += int(char)
  return total

#Alternate Solution:

#def digit_sum(n):
#  total = 0
#  while n > 0:
#    total += n % 10
#    n = n // 10
#  return total
  
print digit_sum(1234)
```
### factorial
All right! Now we’re cooking. Let’s try a factorial problem.

To calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer x, just multiply all the integers from 1 through x. For example:

factorial(4) would equal 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is 24.
factorial(1) would equal 1.
factorial(3) would equal 3 * 2 * 1, which is 6.
##### problem
Define a function factorial that takes an integer x as input.

Calculate and return the factorial of that number.
##### solve
```python
def factorial(x):
    total = 1
    while x>0:
        total *= x
        x-=1
    return total
  
print factorial(5)
```
### is_prime
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. (That’s a mouthful!)

In other words, if you want to test if a number in a variable x is prime, then no other number should go into x evenly besides 1 and x. So 2 and 5 and 11 are all prime, but 4 and 18 and 21 are not.

If there is a number between 1 and x that goes in evenly, then x is not prime.
##### problem
Define a function called is_prime that takes a number x as input.

For each number n from 2 to x - 1, test if x is evenly divisible by n.

If it is, return False.

If none of them are, then return True.
##### solve
```python
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    else:
        for n in range(2, x-1):
            if x % n == 0:
                return False
        return True

print is_prime(13)
print is_prime(10)
```
### anti_vowel
##### problem
Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removed.

For example: anti_vowel("Hey You!") should return "Hy Y!". Don’t count Y as a vowel. Make sure to remove lowercase and uppercase vowels.
##### solve
```python
def anti_vowel(text):
    result = ""
    vowels = "ieaouIEAOU"
    for char in text:
          if char not in vowels:
            result += char
    return result
print anti_vowel("hello book")
```
### reverse
##### plroblem

Define a function called reverse that takes a string textand returns that string in reverse. For example: reverse("abcd") should return "dcba".

You may not use reversed or [::-1] to help you with this.

You may get a string containing special characters (for example, !, @, or #).
##### solve
```python
def reverse(text):
    word = ""
    l = len(text) - 1
    while l >= 0:
        word = word + text[l]
        l -= 1
    return word
  
print reverse("Hello World")
```
### scrabble_score
 
 Scrabble is a game where players get points by spelling words. Words are scored by adding together the point values of each individual letter (we’ll leave out the double and triple letter and word scores for now).

To the right is a dictionary containing all of the letters in the alphabet with their corresponding Scrabble point values.

For example: the word "Helix" would score 15 points due to the sum of the letters: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8.
##### problem

Define a function scrabble_score that takes a string word as input and returns the equivalent scrabble score for that word.

Assume your input is only one word containing no spaces or punctuation.
As mentioned, no need to worry about score multipliers!
Your function should work even if the letters you get are uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.
Assume that you’re only given non-empty strings.
##### solve
```python
score = {"a": 1, "c": 3, "b": 3, "e": 1, "d": 2, "g": 2, 
         "f": 4, "i": 1, "h": 4, "k": 5, "j": 8, "m": 3, 
         "l": 1, "o": 1, "n": 1, "q": 10, "p": 3, "s": 1, 
         "r": 1, "u": 1, "t": 1, "w": 4, "v": 4, "y": 4, 
         "x": 8, "z": 10}
         
def scrabble_score(word):
  word = word.lower()
  total = 0
  for letter in word:
    for leter in score:
      if letter == leter:
        total = total + score[leter]
  return total

print scrabble_score("pizza")
```
### censor
##### problem
```python
Write a function called censor that takes two strings, text and word, as input. It should return the text with the word you chose replaced with asterisks. For example:

censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack") ```

should return: 

```py
"this **** is wack ****"
Assume your input strings won’t contain punctuation or upper case letters.
The number of asterisks you put should correspond to the number of letters in the censored word.
```
##### solve
```python
def censor(text, word):
    words = text.split()
    result = ''
    stars = '*' * len(word)
    count = 0
    for i in words:
        if i == word:
            words[count] = stars
        count += 1
    result =' '.join(words)

    return result
  
print censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack")
```
###### hint
```python
You can use

string.split()
# and 
" ".join(list)
to help you here.

Remember: "*" * 4 equals "****"

After splitting the string with string.split(), you can loop through the indices in the list and replace the words you are looking for with their asterisk equivalent. Join the list at the end to get your sentence!
```
### count
##### problem

Define a function called count that has two arguments called sequence and item.

Return the number of times the item occurs in the list.

For example: count([1, 2, 1, 1], 1) should return 3 (because 1 appears 3 times in the list).

There is a list method in Python that you can use for this, but you should do it the long way for practice.
Your function should return an integer.
The item you input may be an integer, string, float, or even another list!
Be careful not to use list as a variable name in your code—it’s a reserved word in Python!
##### solve
```python
def count(sequence, item):
    count = 0
    for i in sequence:
        if i == item:
            count += 1
    return count
  
print count([1, 2, 1, 1], 1)
```
### purify
##### problem
Define a function called purify that takes in a list of numbers, removes all odd numbers in the list, and returns the result. For example, purify([1,2,3]) should return [2].

Do not directly modify the list you are given as input; instead, return a new list with only the even numbers.

##### solve
```python
def purify(lst):
    res = []
    for ele in lst:
        if ele % 2 == 0:
            res.append(ele)
    return res
  
print purify([1, 2, 3, 4])
```
### product
##### problem
Define a function called product that takes a list of integers as input and returns the product of all of the elements in the list. For example: product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 4 * 5 * 5 is 100).

Don’t worry about the list being empty.
Your function should return an integer.
##### solve
```python
def product(list):
  total = 1
  for num in list:
    total = total * num
  return total

print product([4, 5, 5])
```
### remove_duplicates
##### problem
Write a function remove_duplicates that takes in a list and removes elements of the list that are the same.

For example: remove_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 2]) should return [1, 2].

Don’t remove every occurrence, since you need to keep a single occurrence of a number.
The order in which you present your output does not matter. So returning [1, 2, 3] is the same as returning [3, 1, 2].
Do not modify the list you take as input! Instead, return a new list.
##### solve
```python
def remove_duplicates(inputlist):
    if inputlist == []:
        return []
    
    # Sort the input list from low to high    
    inputlist = sorted(inputlist)
    # Initialize the output list, and give it the first value of the now-sorted input list
    outputlist = [inputlist[0]]

    # Go through the values of the sorted list and append to the output list
    # ...any values that are greater than the last value of the output list
    for i in inputlist:
        if i > outputlist[-1]:
            outputlist.append(i)
        
    return outputlist
  
print remove_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 2])
```
### median
```python
Great work! You’ve covered a lot in these exercises. Last but not least, let’s write a function to find the median of a list.

The median is the middle number in a sorted sequence of numbers.

Finding the median of [7, 12, 3, 1, 6] would first consist of sorting the sequence into [1, 3, 6, 7, 12] and then locating the middle value, which would be 6.

If you are given a sequence with an even number of elements, you must average the two elements surrounding the middle.

For example, the median of the sequence [7, 3, 1, 4] is 3.5, since the middle elements after sorting the list are 3 and 4 and (3 + 4) / (2.0) is 3.5.

You can sort the sequence using the sorted() function, like so:

sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
##### problem
Write a function called median that takes a list as an input and returns the median value of the list. For example: median([1, 1, 2]) should return 1.

The list can be of any size and the numbers are not guaranteed to be in any particular order. Make sure to sort it!
If the list contains an even number of elements, your function should return the average of the middle two.
##### solve
```python
def median(lst):
    sorted_list = sorted(lst)
    if len(sorted_list) % 2 != 0:
        #odd number of elements
        index = len(sorted_list)//2 
        return sorted_list[index]
    elif len(sorted_list) % 2 == 0:
        #even no. of elements
        index_1 = len(sorted_list)/2 - 1
        index_2 = len(sorted_list)/2
        mean = (sorted_list[index_1] + sorted_list[index_2])/2.0
        return mean
   
print median([2, 4, 5, 9])
```
### Print those grades
###### problem
Define a function on line 3 called print_grades with one argument, a list called grades_input.

Inside the function, iterate through grades_input and print each item on its own line.

After your function, call print_grades with the grades list as the parameter.
##### solve
```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def print_grades(grades_input):
  for grade in grades_input:
    print grade

print_grades(grades)
```
### The sum of scores
##### problem
On line 3, define a function, grades_sum, that does the following:

Takes in a list of scores, scores
Computes the sum of the scores
Returns the computed sum.
Call the newly created grades_sum function with the list of grades and print the result.
##### solve
```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def grades_sum(scores):
  total = 0
  for score in scores: 
    total += score
  return total

print grades_sum(grades)
```
### Computing the Average
##### problem
Define a function, grades_average, below the grades_sum function that does the following:

Has one argument, grades_input, a list
Calls grades_sum with grades_input
Computes the average of the grades by dividing that sum by float(len(grades_input)).
Returns the average.
Call the newly created grades_average function with the list of grades and print the result.
##### solve
```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def grades_sum(scores):
  total = 0
  for score in scores: 
    total += score
  return total

print grades_sum(grades)

def grades_average(grades_input):
  sum_of_grades = grades_sum(grades_input)
  average = sum_of_grades / float(len(grades_input))
  return average

print grades_average(grades)
```
### The Variance

##### problem
On line 18, define a new function called grades_variance that accepts one argument, scores, a list.

First, create a variable average and store the result of calling grades_average(scores).

Next, create another variable variance and set it to zero. We will use this as a rolling sum.

for each score in scores: Compute its squared difference: (average - score) ** 2 and add that to variance.

Divide the total variance by the number of scores.

Then, return that result.

Finally, after your function code, print grades_variance(grades).

##### solve
```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def print_grades(grades_input):
  for grade in grades_input:
    print grade

def grades_sum(scores):
  total = 0
  for score in scores: 
    total += score
  return total
    
def grades_average(grades_input):
  sum_of_grades = grades_sum(grades_input)
  average = sum_of_grades / float(len(grades_input))
  return average

def grades_variance(scores):
    average = grades_average(scores)
    variance = 0
    for score in scores:
        variance += (average - score) ** 2
    return variance / len(scores)

print grades_variance(grades)
```
### Standard Deviation
##### problem
Define a function, grades_std_deviation, that takes one argument called variance.

return the result of variance ** 0.5

After the function, create a new variable called variance and store the result of calling grades_variance(grades).

Finally print the result of calling grades_std_deviation(variance).
##### solve
```python
grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def print_grades(grades_input):
  for grade in grades_input:
    print grade

def grades_sum(scores):
  total = 0
  for score in scores: 
    total += score
  return total
    
def grades_average(grades_input):
  sum_of_grades = grades_sum(grades_input)
  average = sum_of_grades / float(len(grades_input))
  return average

def grades_variance(grades):
    variance = 0
    for number in grades:
        variance += (grades_average(grades) - number) ** 2
    return variance / len(grades)

def grades_std_deviation(variance):
  return variance ** 0.5

variance = grades_variance(grades)

print grades_std_deviation(variance)

for grade in grades:
  print grade
print grades_sum(grades)
print grades_average(grades)
print grades_variance(grades)
print grades_std_deviation(variance)
```
### Iterators for Dictionaries
```python
Let’s start with iterating over a dictionary. Recall that a dictionary is just a collection of keys and values.

d = {
  "Name": "Guido",
  "Age": 56,
  "BDFL": True
}
print d.items()
# => [('BDFL', True), ('Age', 56), ('Name', 'Guido')]
Note that the .items() method doesn’t return key/value pairs in any specific order.
```

##### problem
Create your own Python dictionary, my_dict, in the editor to the right with two or three key/value pairs.

Then, print the result of calling the my_dict.items().
##### solve
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Sogol",
          "Age": 30,
          "BDFL": True
          }
print my_dict.items()
```
### keys() and values()
While .items() returns an array of tuples with each tuple consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:

The .keys() method returns a list of the dictionary’s keys, and
The .values() method returns a list of the dictionary’s values.
Again, these methods will not return the keys or values from the dictionary in any specific order.

You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangeable) list. Tuples are surrounded by ()s and can contain any data type.
##### problem
.
Remove your call to .items() and replace it with a call to .keys() and a call to .values(), each on its own line. Make sure to print both!
##### solve
```python
my_dict = {
  'name': 'Nick',
  'age':  31,
  'occupation': 'Dentist',
}

print my_dict.keys()
print my_dict.values()
```
### The 'in' Operator
```python
For iterating over lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings, Python also includes a special keyword: in. You can use in very intuitively, like so:

for number in range(5):
  print number,

d = { 
  "name": "Eric",
  "age": 26
}

for key in d:
  print key, d[key],

for letter in "Eric":
  print letter,  # note the comma!
In the example above, first we create and iterate through a range, printing out 0 1 2 3 4. Note that the trailing comma ensures that we keep printing on the same line.
Next, we create a dictionary and iterate through, printing out age 26 name Eric. Dictionaries have no specific order.
Finally, we iterate through the letters of a string, printing out E r i c.
```
##### problem
For each key in my_dict: print out the key , then a space, then the value stored by that key. (You should use print a, b rather than print a + " " + b.)
##### solve
```python
my_dict = {
  'name': 'Nick',
  'age':  31,
  'occupation': 'Dentist',
}

print my_dict.keys()
print my_dict.values()
for key in my_dict:
  print key, my_dict[key]
  ```
### List Comprehension Syntax
```python
Here’s a simple example of list comprehension syntax:

new_list = [x for x in range(1, 6)]
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
This will create a new_list populated by the numbers one to five. If you want those numbers doubled, you could use:

doubles = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6)]
# => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
And if you only wanted the doubled numbers that are evenly divisible by three:

doubles_by_3 = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6) if (x * 2) % 3 == 0]
# => [6]
```
##### problem
Use a list comprehension to build a list called even_squares in the editor.

Your even_squares list should include the squares of the even numbers between 1 to 11. Your list should start [4, 16, 36...] and go from there.
##### hint
You can use x ** 2 to square a number, and x % 2 == 0 to check if it’s even.
##### solve
```python
doubles_by_3 = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6) if (x * 2) % 3 == 0]

# Complete the following line. Use the line above for help.
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 12) if (x ** 2) % 2 == 0]

print even_squares
```
```python
Great work! Now it’s time for you to create a list comprehension all on your own.

c = ['C' for x in range(5) if x < 3]
print c
The example above creates and prints out a list containing ['C', 'C', 'C'].
```
##### problem
Use a list comprehension to create a list, cubes_by_four.

The comprehension should consist of the cubes of the numbers 1 through 10 only if the cube is evenly divisible by four.

Finally, print that list to the console.

Note that in this case, the cubed number should be evenly divisible by 4, not the original number.
##### solve
```python
cubes_by_four = [x ** 3 for x in range(1, 11) if ((x ** 3) % 4) == 0]
print cubes_by_four
```
### List Slicing Syntax
```python
Sometimes we only want part of a Python list. Maybe we only want the first few elements; maybe we only want the last few. Maybe we want every other element!

List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this:

[start:end:stride]
Where start describes where the slice starts (inclusive), end is where it ends (exclusive), and stride describes the space between items in the sliced list. For example, a stride of 2 would select every other item from the original list to place in the sliced list.
```
##### problem
We’ve generated a list with a list comprehension in the editor to the right, and we’re about to print a selection from the list using list slicing. Can you guess what will be printed out? Click Run when you think you know!
##### solve
```python
l = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]
# Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

print l[2:9:2]

 when you run --> [9, 25, 49, 81]
 ```
### Omitting Indices
```python
If you don’t pass a particular index to the list slice, Python will pick a default.

to_five = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

print to_five[3:]
# prints ['D', 'E'] 

print to_five[:2]
# prints ['A', 'B']

print to_five[::2]
# print ['A', 'C', 'E']
The default starting index is 0.
The default ending index is the end of the list.
The default stride is 1.
```
##### problem
Use list slicing to print out every odd element of my_list from start to finish.

Omit the start and end index. You only need to specify a stride.
##### solve
```python
my_list = range(1, 11) # List of numbers 1 - 10

# Add your code below!
print my_list[::2]
```
### Reversing a List
```python
We have seen that a positive stride progresses through the list from left to right.

A negative stride progresses through the list from right to left.

letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
print letters[::-1]
In the example above, we print out ['E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A'].
```
##### problem
Create a variable called backwards and set it equal to the reversed version of my_list.

Make sure to reverse the list in the editor by passing your list slice a negative stride, like in the example above.
##### solve
```python
my_list = range(1, 11)

# Add your code below!
backwards = my_list[::-1]
when you run --> [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
### Stride Length
A positive stride length traverses the list from left to right, and a negative one traverses the list from right to left.

Further, a stride length of 1 traverses the list “by ones,” a stride length of 2 traverses the list “by twos,” and so on.
##### problem
Create a variable, backwards_by_tens, and set it equal to the result of going backwards through to_one_hundred by tens. Go ahead and print backwards_by_tens to the console.
##### solve
```python
to_one_hundred = range(101)
# Add your code below!

backwards_by_tens = to_one_hundred[::-10]
print backwards_by_tens
when you run --> [100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 0]
```
##### problem
Create a list, to_21, that’s just the numbers from 1 to 21, inclusive.

Create a second list, odds, that contains only the odd numbers in the to_21 list (1, 3, 5, and so on). Use list slicing for this one instead of a list comprehension.

Finally, create a third list, middle_third, that’s equal to the middle third of to_21, from 8 to 14, inclusive.
##### solve
```python
to_21 = range(1, 22)

odds = to_21[::2]

middle_third = to_21[7:14]
```
###  Anonymous Functions
```python
One of the more powerful aspects of Python is that it allows for a style of programming called functional programming, which means that you’re allowed to pass functions around just as if they were variables or values. Sometimes we take this for granted, but not all languages allow this!

Check out the code at the right. See the lambda bit? Typing

lambda x: x % 3 == 0
Is the same as

def by_three(x):
  return x % 3 == 0
Only we don’t need to actually give the function a name; it does its work and returns a value without one. That’s why the function the lambda creates is an anonymous function.

When we pass the lambda to filter, filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter, and the second argument (my_list, which is just the numbers 0 – 15) is the list it does the filtering on.
```
##### problem
Can you guess what the this code will print to the console? Click Run to see.
##### solve
```python
my_list = range(16)
print filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)
when you run --> [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
```
### Lambda Syntax
```python
Lambda functions are defined using the following syntax:

my_list = range(16)
filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)
Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.

If you plan on creating a function you’ll use over and over, you’re better off using def and giving that function a name.
```
##### problem
.
Fill in the first part of the filter function with a lambda. The lambda should ensure that only "Python" is returned by the filter.

Fill in the second part of the filter function with languages, the list to filter
##### solve
```python
languages = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]

# Add arguments to the filter()
print filter(lambda x: x == "Python", languages)
when you run --> ['Python']
```
### lambda
```python
All right! Time to test out filter() and lambda expressions.

cubes = [x ** 3 for x in range(1, 11)]
filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, cubes)
```
##### problem 
.
Create a list, squares, that consists of the squares of the numbers 1 to 10. A list comprehension could be useful here!

Use filter() and a lambda expression to print out only the squares that are between 30 and 70 (inclusive).
##### solve
```python
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11)]

print filter(lambda x: x >= 30 and x <= 70, squares)

when you run --> [36, 49, 64]
```
### Iterating Over Dictionaries
##### problem
Call the appropriate method on movies such that it will print out all the items (hint, hint) in the dictionary—that is, each key and each value.
##### solve
```python
movies = {
  "Monty Python and the Holy Grail": "Great",
  "Monty Python's Life of Brian": "Good",
  "Monty Python's Meaning of Life": "Okay"
}

print movies.items()
```
### Comprehending Comprehensions
```python
Good! Now let’s take another look at list comprehensions.

squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]
```
##### problem
Use a list comprehension to create a list, threes_and_fives, that consists only of the numbers between 1 and 15 (inclusive) that are evenly divisible by 3 or 5.
##### solve
```python
threes_and_fives = [x for x in range(1, 16) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0]
```
##### problem
The string in the editor is garbled in two ways:

Our message is backwards.
The letter we want is every other letter.
Use list slicing to extract the message and save it to a variable called message.
##### solve
```python
garbled = "!XeXgXaXsXsXeXmX XtXeXrXcXeXsX XeXhXtX XmXaX XI"

message = garbled[::-2]
```
##### problem
Create a new variable called message.

Set it to the result of calling filter() with the appropriate lambda that will filter out the "X"s. The second argument will be garbled.

Finally, print your message to the console.
##### solve
```python
garbled = "IXXX aXXmX aXXXnXoXXXXXtXhXeXXXXrX sXXXXeXcXXXrXeXt mXXeXsXXXsXaXXXXXXgXeX!XX"

message = filter(lambda x: x != "X", garbled)
print message
```
### Just a Little BIT
```python
print 5 >> 4  # Right Shift
print 5 << 1  # Left Shift
print 8 & 5   # Bitwise AND
print 9 | 4   # Bitwise OR
print 12 ^ 42 # Bitwise XOR
print ~88     # Bitwise NOT

when you run --> 0
10
0

38
-89
 ```
### Lesson I0 The Base 2 Number System

When we count, we usually do it in base 10. That means that each place in a number can hold one of ten values, 0-9. In binary we count in base two, where each place can hold one of two values: 0 or 1. The counting pattern is the same as in base 10 except when you carry over to a new column, you have to carry over every time a place goes higher than one (as opposed to higher than 9 in base 10).

For example, the numbers one and zero are the same in base 10 and base 2. But in base 2, once you get to the number 2 you have to carry over the one, resulting in the representation “10”. Adding one again results in “11” (3) and adding one again results in “100” (4).

Contrary to counting in base 10, where each decimal place represents a power of 10, each place in a binary number represents a power of two (or a bit). The rightmost bit is the 1’s bit (two to the zero power), the next bit is the 2’s bit (two to the first), then 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

The binary number ‘1010’ is 10 in base 2 because the 8’s bit and the 2’s bit are “on”:

8's bit  4's bit  2's bit  1's bit
    1       0       1      0 
    8   +   0    +  2   +  0  = 10 
In Python, you can write numbers in binary format by starting the number with 0b. When doing so, the numbers can be operated on like any other number!

##### example
```python
print 0b1,    #1
print 0b10,   #2
print 0b11,   #3
print 0b100,  #4
print 0b101,  #5
print 0b110,  #6
print 0b111   #7
print "******"
print 0b1 + 0b11
print 0b11 * 0b11

when you run --> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
******
4
9
```
### I Can Count to 1100
```python
All right! Time to practice counting in binary.

To make sure you’ve got the hang of it, fill out the rest of the numbers all the way up to twelve. Please do not use the str() method or any other outside functions.

Here are a few numbers that will be good to know going forward -

2 ** 0 = 1
2 ** 1 = 2
2 ** 2 = 4
2 ** 3 = 8
2 ** 4 = 16
2 ** 5 = 32
2 ** 6 = 64
2 ** 7 = 128
2 ** 8 = 256
2 ** 9 = 512
2 ** 10 = 1024
You may recognize these numbers. Do you have a 32 or 64 bit system? Does your computer have a 256GB hard drive? Computers think in binary!
```
##### problem
Fill out the rest of the numbers with their corresponding binary values up to twelve in the editor to the right, using the 0bxxx format.
##### solve
```python
one = 0b1
two = 0b10
three = 0b11
four = 0b100
five = 0b101
six  = 0b110
seven = 0b111
eight = 0b1000
nine  = 0b1001
ten = 0b1010
eleven = 0b1011
twelve = 0b1100
```
### The bin Function
Excellent! The biggest hurdle you have to jump over in order to understand bitwise operators is learning how to count in base 2. Hopefully the lesson should be easier for you from here on out.

There are Python functions that can aid you with bitwise operations. In order to print a number in its binary representation, you can use the bin() function. bin() takes an integer as input and returns the binary representation of that integer in a string. (Keep in mind that after using the bin function, you can no longer operate on the value like a number.)

You can also represent numbers in base 8 and base 16 using the oct() and hex() functions. (We won’t be dealing with those here, however.)

##### problem
We’ve provided an example of the bin function in the editor. Go ahead and use print and bin() to print out the binary representations of the numbers 2 through 5, each on its own line.
##### solve
```python
print bin(1)
print bin(2)
print bin(3)
print bin(4)
print bin(5)
```
### int Second Parameter
Python has an int() function that you’ve seen a bit of already. It can turn non-integer input into an integer, like this:

int("42")
### ==> 42
What you might not know is that the int function actually has an optional second parameter.

int("110", 2)
### ==> 6
When given a string containing a number and the base that number is in, the function will return the value of that number converted to base ten.
##### problem 
In the console are several different ways that you can use the int function’s second parameter.On line 7, use int to print the base 10 equivalent of the binary number 11001001.
##### solve
```python
print int("1",2)
print int("10",2)
print int("111",2)
print int("0b100",2)
print int(bin(5),2)
# Print out the decimal equivalent of the binary 11001001.
print int("11001001", 2)
```
### Slide to the Left Slide to the Right
```python
The next two operations we are going to talk about are the left and right shift bitwise operators. These operators work by shifting the bits of a number over by a designated number of slots.

The block below shows how these operators work on the bit level. Note that in the diagram, the shift is always a positive integer:

# Left Bit Shift (<<)  
0b000001 << 2 == 0b000100 (1 << 2 = 4)
0b000101 << 3 == 0b101000 (5 << 3 = 40)       

# Right Bit Shift (>>)
0b0010100 >> 3 == 0b000010 (20 >> 3 = 2)
0b0000010 >> 2 == 0b000000 (2 >> 2 = 0) 
Shift operations are similar to rounding down after dividing and multiplying by 2 (respectively) for every time you shift, but it’s often easier just to think of it as shifting all the 1s and 0s left or right by the specified number of slots.

Note that you can only do bitwise operations on an integer. Trying to do them on strings or floats will result in nonsensical output!
```
##### problem
Shift the variable shift_right to the right twice (>> 2) and shift the variable shift_left to the left twice (<< 2). Try to guess what the printed output will be!
##### solve
```python
shift_right = 0b1100
shift_left = 0b1

# Your code here!
shift_right = shift_right >> 2
shift_left = shift_left << 2

print bin(shift_right)
print bin(shift_left)
```
##### A BIT of This AND That
```python
The bitwise AND (&) operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if the corresponding bits of both numbers are 1. For example:

     a:   00101010   42
     b:   00001111   15       
===================
 a & b:   00001010   10
As you can see, the 2’s bit and the 8’s bit are the only bits that are on in both a and b, so a & b only contains those bits. Note that using the & operator can only result in a number that is less than or equal to the smaller of the two values.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1
Therefore,

0b111 (7) & 0b1010 (10) = 0b10
which equals two.
```
##### problem
print out the result of calling bin() on 0b1110 & 0b101.

See if you can guess what the output will be!
##### solve
```python
print bin(0b1110 & 0b101)
```
### A BIT of This OR That
```python
The bitwise OR (|) operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if either of the corresponding bits of either number are 1. For example:

    a:  00101010  42
    b:  00001111  15       
================
a | b:  00101111  47
Note that the bitwise | operator can only create results that are greater than or equal to the larger of the two integer inputs.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 | 0 = 0
0 | 1 = 1 
1 | 0 = 1
1 | 1 = 1
Meaning

110 (6) | 1010 (10) = 1110 (14)
```
##### problem
.
For practice, print out the result of using | on 0b1110 and 0b101 as a binary string. Try to do it on your own without using the | operator if you can help it.
##### solve
```python
print bin(0b1110 | 0b101)
```
### This XOR That
The XOR (^) or exclusive or operator compares two numbers on a bit level and returns a number where the bits of that number are turned on if either of the corresponding bits of the two numbers are 1, but not both.

    a:  00101010   42
    b:  00001111   15       
================
a ^ b:  00100101   37
Keep in mind that if a bit is off in both numbers, it stays off in the result. Note that XOR-ing a number with itself will always result in 0.

So remember, for every given bit in a and b:

0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
Therefore:

 111 (7) ^ 1010 (10) = 1101 (13)
 ##### problem
 For practice, print the result of using ^ on 0b1110 and 0b101 as a binary string. Try to do it on your own without using the ^ operator.
 ##### solve
 ```python
 print bin(0b1110 ^ 0b101)
 ```
 ### This is NOT That Hard
 The bitwise NOT operator (~) just flips all of the bits in a single number. What this actually means to the computer is actually very complicated, so we’re not going to get into it. Just know that mathematically, this is equivalent to adding one to the number and then making it negative.

And with that, you’ve seen all of the basic bitwise operators! We’ll see what we can do with these in the next section.
##### problem
Click Run and observe what the console prints out.
##### solve
```python
print ~1
print ~2
print ~3
print ~42
print ~123
return:
-2
-3
-4
-43
-124
```
### The Man Behind the Bit Mask
```python
A bit mask is just a variable that aids you with bitwise operations. A bit mask can help you turn specific bits on, turn others off, or just collect data from an integer about which bits are on or off.

num  = 0b1100
mask = 0b0100
desired = num & mask
if desired > 0:
  print "Bit was on"
In the example above, we want to see if the third bit from the right is on.

First, we first create a variable num containing the number 12, or 0b1100.
Next, we create a mask with the third bit on.
Then, we use a bitwise-and operation to see if the third bit from the right of num is on.
If desired is greater than zero, then the third bit of num must have been one.
```
##### problem
Define a function, check_bit4, with one argument, input, an integer.

It should check to see if the fourth bit from the right is on.

If the bit is on, return "on" (not print!)

If the bit is off, return "off".

Check the Hint for some examples!
##### solve
```python
def check_bit4(input):
  mask = 0b1000
  desired = input & mask
  if desired > 0:
    return "on"
  else:
    return "off"
 ```
 ### Turn It On
 ```python
 You can also use masks to turn a bit in a number on using |. For example, let’s say I want to make sure the rightmost bit of number a is turned on. I could do this:

a = 0b110 # 6
mask = 0b1 # 1
desired =  a | mask # 0b111, or 7
Using the bitwise | operator will turn a corresponding bit on if it is off and leave it on if it is already on.
```
##### problem
In the editor is a variable, a. Use a bitmask and the value a in order to achieve a result where the third bit from the right of a is turned on. Be sure to print your answer as a bin() string!
##### solve
```python
a = 0b10111011

mask = 0b100
desired = a | mask
print bin(desired)
return:
0b10111111
```
### Just Flip Out
```python
Using the XOR (^) operator is very useful for flipping bits. Using ^ on a bit with the number one will return a result where that bit is flipped.

For example, let’s say I want to flip all of the bits in a. I might do this:

a = 0b110 # 6
mask = 0b111 # 7
desired =  a ^ mask # 0b1
```
##### problem
In the editor is the 8 bit variable a. Use a bitmask and the value a in order to achieve a result where all of the bits in a are flipped. Be sure to print your answer as a bin() string!
##### solve
```python
a = 0b11101110

mask = 0b11111111
desired = a ^ mask

print bin(desired)
```
### Slip and Slide
```python
Finally, you can also use the left shift (<<) and right shift (>>) operators to slide masks into place.

a = 0b101 
# Tenth bit mask
mask = (0b1 << 9)  # One less than ten 
desired = a ^ mask
Let’s say that I want to turn on the 10th bit from the right of the integer a.

Instead of writing out the entire number, we slide a bit over using the << operator.

We use 9 because we only need to slide the mask nine places over from the first bit to reach the tenth bit.
```
##### problem

Define a function called flip_bit that takes the inputs (number, n).

Flip the nth bit (with the ones bit being the first bit) and store it in result.

Return the result of calling bin(result).
##### solve
```python
def flip_bit(number, n):
  bit_to_flip = 0b1 << (n -1)
  result = number ^ bit_to_flip
  return bin(result)
  ```
  ### Why Use Classes
  
  Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects. You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods. For example, any time you call

len("Eric")
Python is checking to see whether the string object you passed it has a length, and if it does, it returns the value associated with that attribute. When you call

my_dict.items()
Python checks to see if my_dict has an items() method (which all dictionaries have) and executes that method if it finds it.

But what makes "Eric" a string and my_dict a dictionary? The fact that they’re instances of the str and dict classes, respectively. A class is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods.
```python
class Fruit(object):
  """A class that makes various tasty fruits."""
  def __init__(self, name, color, flavor, poisonous):
    self.name = name
    self.color = color
    self.flavor = flavor
    self.poisonous = poisonous

  def description(self):
    print "I'm a %s %s and I taste %s." % (self.color, self.name, self.flavor)

  def is_edible(self):
    if not self.poisonous:
      print "Yep! I'm edible."
    else:
      print "Don't eat me! I am super poisonous."

lemon = Fruit("lemon", "yellow", "sour", False)

lemon.description()
lemon.is_edible()
run mikoni:
I'm a yellow lemon and I taste sour.
Yep! I'm edible.
```
### Class Syntax

A basic class consists only of the class keyword, the name of the class, and the class from which the new class inherits in parentheses. (We’ll get to inheritance soon.) For now, our classes will inherit from the object class, like so:
```python
class NewClass(object):
  # Class magic here
  ```
This gives them the powers and abilities of a Python object. By convention, user-defined Python class names start with a capital letter.
##### problem
Create a class called Animal in the editor. For now, in the body of your class, use the pass keyword. (pass doesn’t do anything, but it’s useful as a placeholder in areas of your code where Python expects an expression.)
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  pass
```
### Classier Classes

We’d like our classes to do more than… well, nothing, so we’ll have to replace our pass with something else.

You may have noticed in our example back in the first exercise that we started our class definition off with an odd-looking function: __init__(). This function is required for classes, and it’s used to initialize the objects it creates. __init__() always takes at least one argument, self, that refers to the object being created. You can think of __init__() as the function that “boots up” each object the class creates.
##### problem
Remove the pass statement in your class definition, then go ahead and define an __init__() function for your Animal class. Pass it the argument self for now; we’ll explain how this works in greater detail in the next section. Finally, put the pass into the body of the __init__() definition, since it will expect an indented block.
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  def __init__(self):
    pass
 ```
 ### Lets Not Get Too Selfish
 Excellent! Let’s make one more tweak to our class definition, then go ahead and instantiate (create) our first object.

So far, __init__() only takes one parameter: self. This is a Python convention; there’s nothing magic about the word self. However, it’s overwhelmingly common to use self as the first parameter in __init__(), so you should do this so that other people will understand your code.

The part that is magic is the fact that self is the first parameter passed to __init__(). Python will use the first parameter that __init__() receives to refer to the object being created; this is why it’s often called self, since this parameter gives the object being created its identity.
##### problem
.
Let’s do two things in the editor:

Pass __init__() a second parameter, name.
In the body of __init__(), let the function know that name refers to the created object’s name by typing self.name = name. (This will become crystal clear in the next section.)
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
```
 ### Instantiating Your First Object
 ```python
 Perfect! Now we’re ready to start creating objects.

We can access attributes of our objects using dot notation. Here’s how it works:

class Square(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.sides = 4

my_shape = Square()
print my_shape.sides
First we create a class named Square with an attribute sides.
Outside the class definition, we create a new instance of Square named my_shape and access that attribute using my_shape.sides.
```
##### problem
Outside the Animal class definition, create a variable named zebra and set it equal to Animal("Jeffrey").

Then print out zebra‘s name.
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    
zebra = Animal("Jeffrey")
print zebra.name
```
### More on self
 
Now that you’re starting to understand how classes and objects work, it’s worth delving a bit more into __init__() and self. They can be confusing!

As mentioned, you can think of __init__() as the method that “boots up” a class’ instance object: the init bit is short for “initialize.”

The first argument __init__() gets is used to refer to the instance object, and by convention, that argument is called self. If you add additional arguments—for instance, a name and age for your animal—setting each of those equal to self.name and self.age in the body of __init__() will make it so that when you create an instance object of your Animal class, you need to give each instance a name and an age, and those will be associated with the particular instance you create.
##### problem
.
Check out the examples in the editor. See how __init__() “boots up” each object to expect a name and an age, then uses self.name and self.age to assign those names and ages to each object? Add a third attribute, is_hungry to __init__(), and click Run to see the results.
##### solve
```python
# Class definition
class Animal(object):
  """Makes cute animals."""
  # For initializing our instance objects
  def __init__(self, name, age, is_hungry):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.is_hungry = is_hungry

# Note that self is only used in the __init__()
# function definition; we don't need to pass it
# to our instance objects.

zebra = Animal("Jeffrey", 2, True)
giraffe = Animal("Bruce", 1, False)
panda = Animal("Chad", 7, True)

print zebra.name, zebra.age, zebra.is_hungry
print giraffe.name, giraffe.age, giraffe.is_hungry
print panda.name, panda.age, panda.is_hungry
```
### Class Scope
Another important aspect of Python classes is scope. The scope of a variable is the context in which it’s visible to the program.

It may surprise you to learn that not all variables are accessible to all parts of a Python program at all times. When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are available everywhere (global variables), variables that are only available to members of a certain class (member variables), and variables that are only available to particular instances of a class (instance variables).

The same goes for functions: some are available everywhere, some are only available to members of a certain class, and still others are only available to particular instance objects.
##### problem
.
Check out the code in the editor. Note that each individual animal gets its own name and age (since they’re all initialized individually), but they all have access to the member variable is_alive, since they’re all members of the Animal class. Click Run to see the output!
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  """Makes cute animals."""
  is_alive = True
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

zebra = Animal("Jeffrey", 2)
giraffe = Animal("Bruce", 1)
panda = Animal("Chad", 7)

print zebra.name, zebra.age, zebra.is_alive
print giraffe.name, giraffe.age, giraffe.is_alive
print panda.name, panda.age, panda.is_alive
when run:
Jeffrey 2 True
Bruce 1 True
Chad 7 True
```
### A Methodical Approach
When a class has its own functions, those functions are called methods. You’ve already seen one such method: __init__(). But you can also define your own methods!
##### problem
Add a method, description, to your Animal class. Using two separate print statements, it should print out the name and age of the animal it’s called on. Then, create an instance of Animal, hippo (with whatever name and age you like), and call its description method.
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  """Makes cute animals."""
  is_alive = True
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  # Add your method here!
  def description(self):
    print self.name
    print self.age
    
hippo = Animal("Anderson", 36)
hippo.description()
```
### They are Multiplying
```python
A class can have any number of member variables. These are variables that are available to all members of a class.

hippo = Animal("Jake", 12)
cat = Animal("Boots", 3)
print hippo.is_alive
hippo.is_alive = False
print hippo.is_alive
print cat.is_alive
In the example above, we create two instances of an Animal.
Then we print out True, the default value stored in hippo’s is_alive member variable.
Next, we set that to False and print it out to make sure.
Finally, we print out True, the value stored in cat’s is_alive member variable. We only changed the variable in hippo, not in cat.
Let’s add another member variable to Animal.
```
##### problem
After line 3, add a second member variable called health that contains the string "good".

Then, create two new Animals: sloth and ocelot. (Give them whatever names and ages you like.)

Finally, on three separate lines, print out the health of your hippo, sloth, and ocelot.
##### solve
```python
class Animal(object):
  """Makes cute animals."""
  is_alive = True
  health = "good"
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  # Add your method here!
  def description(self):
    print self.name
    print self.age
    
hippo = Animal('Anderson', 36)
sloth = Animal('Dale', 15)
ocelot = Animal('Fuzzy', 7)

print hippo.health
print sloth.health
print ocelot.health
```
### It is Not All Animals and Fruits

Classes like Animal and Fruit make it easy to understand the concepts of classes and instances, but you probably won’t see many zebras or lemons in real-world programs.

However, classes and objects are often used to model real-world objects. The code in the editor is a more realistic demonstration of the kind of classes and objects you might find in commercial software. Here we have a basic ShoppingCart class for creating shopping cart objects for website customers; though basic, it’s similar to what you’d see in a real program.

##### problem
.
Create an instance of ShoppingCart called my_cart. Initialize it with any values you like, then use the add_item method to add an item to your cart.
##### solve
```python
class ShoppingCart(object):
  """Creates shopping cart objects
  for users of our fine website."""
  
  def __init__(self, customer_name):
    self.customer_name = customer_name
    self.items_in_cart = {}
  def add_item(self, product, price):
    """Add product to the cart."""
    if not product in self.items_in_cart:
      self.items_in_cart[product] = price
      print product + " added."
    else:
      print product + " is already in the cart."

  def remove_item(self, product):
    """Remove product from the cart."""
    if product in self.items_in_cart:
      del self.items_in_cart[product]
      print product + " removed."
    else:
      print product + " is not in the cart."

my_cart = ShoppingCart("Eric")
my_cart.add_item("Ukelele", 10)
```
### Here Be Dragons
Inheritance is a tricky concept, so let’s go through it step by step.

Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it’s used to express an is-a relationship. For example, a Panda is a bear, so a Panda class could inherit from a Bear class. However, a Toyota is not a Tractor, so it shouldn’t inherit from the Tractor class (even if they have a lot of attributes and methods in common). Instead, both Toyota and Tractor could ultimately inherit from the same Vehicle class.
##### problem

Check out the code in the editor. We’ve defined a class, Customer, as well as a ReturningCustomer class that inherits from Customer. Note that we don’t define the display_cart method in the body of ReturningCustomer, but it will still have access to that method via inheritance. Click Run to see for yourself!
##### solve
```python
class Customer(object):
    """Produces objects that represent customers."""
    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id

    def display_cart(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!"

class ReturningCustomer(Customer):
    """For customers of the repeat variety."""
    def display_order_history(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for your order history!"

monty_python = ReturningCustomer("ID: 12345")
monty_python.display_cart()
monty_python.display_order_history()

when run:
I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!
I'm a string that stands in for your order history!
```
### Inheritance Syntax
```python
In Python, inheritance works like this:

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
  # code goes here
where DerivedClass is the new class you’re making and BaseClass is the class from which that new class inherits.
```
##### problem
```python
1.
On lines 1-4, we’ve created a class named Shape.

Create your own class, Triangle, that inherits from Shape, like this:
class Triangle(Shape):
# code goes here
Inside the Triangle class, write an __init__() function that takes four arguments: self, side1, side2, and side3.
Inside the __init__() function, set self.side1 = side1, self.side2 = side2, and self.side3 = side3.
```
##### solve
```python
class Shape(object):
    """Makes shapes!"""
    def __init__(self, number_of_sides):
        self.number_of_sides = number_of_sides

# Add your Triangle class below!
class Triangle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, side1, side2, side3):
    self.side1 = side1
    self.side2 = side2
    self.side3 = side3
 ```
 ### Override
 
 ```python
 Sometimes you’ll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent, but to override one or more of them.

class Employee(object):
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
  def greet(self, other):
    print "Hello, %s" % other.name

class CEO(Employee):
  def greet(self, other):
    print "Get back to work, %s!" % other.name

ceo = CEO("Emily")
emp = Employee("Steve")
emp.greet(ceo)
# Hello, Emily
ceo.greet(emp)
# Get back to work, Steve!
Rather than have a separate greet_underling method for our CEO, we override (or re-create) the greet method on top of the base Employee.greet method. This way, we don’t need to know what type of Employee we have before we greet another Employee.
```
##### problem

Create a new class, PartTimeEmployee, that inherits from Employee.

Give your derived class a calculate_wage method that overrides Employee‘s. It should take self and hours as arguments.

Because PartTimeEmployee.calculate_wage overrides Employee.calculate_wage, it still needs to set self.hours = hours.

It should return the part-time employee’s number of hours worked multiplied by 12.00 (that is, they get $12.00 per hour instead of $20.00).
##### solve
```python
class Employee(object):
  """Models real-life employees!"""
  def __init__(self, employee_name):
    self.employee_name = employee_name

  def calculate_wage(self, hours):
    self.hours = hours
    return hours * 20.00

# Add your code below!
class PartTimeEmployee(Employee):
  def calculate_wage(self, hours):
    self.hours = hours
    return hours * 12.00
  ```
### This Looks Like a Job For
```python
On the flip side, sometimes you’ll be working with a derived class (or subclass) and realize that you’ve overwritten a method or attribute defined in that class’ base class (also called a parent or superclass) that you actually need. Have no fear! You can directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass with Python’s built-in super call.

The syntax looks like this:

class Derived(Base):
  def m(self):
    return super(Derived, self).m()
Where m() is a method from the base class.
```
##### problem
First, inside your PartTimeEmployee class:

Add a new method called full_time_wage with the arguments self and hours.
That method should return the result of a super call to the calculate_wage method of PartTimeEmployee‘s parent class. Use the example above for help.
Then, after your class:

Create an instance of the PartTimeEmployee class called milton. Don’t forget to give it a name.
Finally, print out the result of calling his full_time_wage method. You should see his wage printed out at $20.00 per hour! (That is, for 10 hours, the result should be 200.00.)
##### solve
```python
class Employee(object):
  """Models real-life employees!"""
  def __init__(self, employee_name):
    self.employee_name = employee_name

  def calculate_wage(self, hours):
    self.hours = hours
    return hours * 20.00

# Add your code below!
class PartTimeEmployee(Employee):
  def calculate_wage(self, hours):
    self.hours = hours
    return hours * 12.00
  
  def full_time_wage(self, hours):
    return super(PartTimeEmployee, self).calculate_wage(hours)

milton = PartTimeEmployee('Milton')
print milton.full_time_wage(10)
```
### Class Basics
##### problem
Create a class, Triangle. Its __init__() method should take self, angle1, angle2, and angle3 as arguments. Make sure to set these appropriately in the body of the __init__() method (see the Hint for more).
##### solve
```python
class Triangle(object):
  def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
    self.angle1 = angle1
    self.angle2 = angle2
    self.angle3 = angle3
```
### Class It Up
##### problem
Inside the Triangle class:

Create a variable named number_of_sides and set it equal to 3.
Create a method named check_angles. The sum of a triangle’s three angles should return True if the sum of self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 is equal 180, and False otherwise.
###### solve
```python
class Triangle(object):
  def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
    self.angle1 = angle1
    self.angle2 = angle2
    self.angle3 = angle3
  number_of_sides = 3
  def check_angles(self):
    if (self.angle1 + self.angle2 + self.angle3 == 180):
      return True
    else:
      return False
  ```
### Instantiate an Object
##### problem
.
Create a variable named my_triangle and set it equal to a new instance of your Triangle class. Pass it three angles that sum to 180 (e.g. 90, 30, 60).

Print out my_triangle.number_of_sides

Print out my_triangle.check_angles()
##### solve
```python
class Triangle(object):
  number_of_sides = 3
  def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
    self.angle1 = angle1
    self.angle2 = angle2
    self.angle3 = angle3
    
  def check_angles(self):
    if (self.angle1 + self.angle2 + self.angle3) == 180:
      return True
    else:
      return False
    
my_triangle = Triangle(30, 60, 90)

print my_triangle.number_of_sides
print my_triangle.check_angles()

```
### Inheritance
##### problem
Create a class named Equilateral that inherits from Triangle.

Inside Equilateral, create a member variable named angle and set it equal to 60.

Create an __init__() function with only the parameter self, and set self.angle1, self.angle2, and self.angle3 equal to self.angle (since an equilateral triangle’s angles will always be 60˚).
##### solve
```python
class Triangle(object):
  number_of_sides = 3
  def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
    self.angle1 = angle1
    self.angle2 = angle2
    self.angle3 = angle3
    
  def check_angles(self):
    if (self.angle1 + self.angle2 + self.angle3) == 180:
      return True
    else:
      return False
    
class Equilateral(Triangle):
  angle = 60
  def __init__(self):
    self.angle1 = self.angle
    self.angle2 = self.angle
    self.angle3 = self.angle
 ```
    
### Practice class
##### problem
Define a new class named “Car”. For now, since we have to put something inside the class, use the pass keyword.
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  pass
  ```
  ##### problem
  Below your Car class, create a new object named my_car that is an instance of Car.
  ##### solve
  ```python
  class Car(object):
  pass

my_car = Car()
```
##### problem
Inside your Car class, replace the pass statement with a new member variable named condition and give it an initial value of the string "new".
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
 condition = "new"

my_car = Car()
```
##### problem
At the end of your code, use a print statement to display the condition of my_car.
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
 condition = "new"

my_car = Car()
print my_car.condition
```
##### problem
Define the __init__() function of the Car class to take four inputs: self, model, color, and mpg. Assign the last three inputs to member variables of the same name by using the self keyword.

Then, modify the object my_car to provide the following inputs at initialization:

model = "DeLorean"
color = "silver"
mpg = 88
You don’t need to include the self keyword when you create an instance of a class, because self gets added to the beginning of your list of inputs automatically by the class definition.
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)
```
##### problem
Now that you’ve created my_car print its member variables:

First print the model of my_car. Click “Stuck? Get a hint!” for an example.
Then print out the color of my_car.
Then print out the mpg of my_car.
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)
print my_car.model
print my_car.color
print my_car.mpg
```
##### problem
Inside the Car class, add a method named display_car to Car that will reference the Car’s member variables to return the string, "This is a [color] [model] with [mpg] MPG." You can use the str() function to turn your mpg into a string when creating the display string.

Replace the individual print statements with a single print command that displays the result of calling my_car.display_car()
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
   
  def display_car(self):
    print "This is a %s %s with %s MPG." % (self.color, self.model, str(self.mpg))

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)

my_car.display_car()
```
##### problem
Inside the Car class, add a method drive_car that sets self.condition to the string "used".

Remove the call to my_car.display_car() and instead print only the condition of your car.

Then drive your car by calling the drive_car method.

Finally, print the condition of your car again to see how its value changes.
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
   
  def display_car(self):
    print "This is a %s %s with %s MPG." % (self.color, self.model, str(self.mpg))
    
  def drive_car(self):
    self.condition = "used"

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)

print my_car.condition
my_car.drive_car()
print my_car.condition
```
##### problem
Create a class ElectricCar that inherits from Car. Give your new class an __init__() method of that includes a battery_type member variable in addition to the model, color and mpg.

Then, create an electric car named my_car with a "molten salt" battery_type. Supply values of your choice for the other three inputs (model, color and mpg).
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
   
  def display_car(self):
    print "This is a %s %s with %s MPG." % (self.color, self.model, str(self.mpg))
    
  def drive_car(self):
    self.condition = "used"
    
class ElectricCar(Car):
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg, battery_type):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
    self.battery_type = battery_type

my_car = ElectricCar("DeLorean", "silver", 88, "molten salt")
```
##### problem
Inside ElectricCar add a new method drive_car that changes the car’s condition to the string "like new".

Then, outside of ElectricCar, print the condition of my_car

Next, drive my_car by calling the drive_car function

Finally, print the condition of my_car again
##### solve
```python
class Car(object):
  condition = "new"
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
   
  def display_car(self):
    print "This is a %s %s with %s MPG." % (self.color, self.model, str(self.mpg))
    
  def drive_car(self):
    self.condition = "used"
    
class ElectricCar(Car):
  def __init__(self, model, color, mpg, battery_type):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    self.mpg   = mpg
    self.battery_type = battery_type
    
  def drive_car(self):
    self.condition = "like new"

my_car = ElectricCar("DeLorean", "silver", 88, "molten salt")

print my_car.condition
my_car.drive_car()
print my_car.condition
```
##### problem
Define a Point3D class that inherits from object

Inside the Point3D class, define an __init__() function that accepts self, x, y, and z, and assigns these numbers to the member variables self.x, self.y, self.z

Define a __repr__() method that returns "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z). This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z).

Outside the class definition, create a variable named my_point containing a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3.

Finally, print my_point.
##### solve
```python
class Point3D(object):
  def __init__(self, x, y, z):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.z = z
    
  def __repr__(self):
    return "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z)
    
my_point = Point3D(1, 2, 3)
print my_point

```
### See It to Believe It
Until now, the Python code you’ve been writing comes from one source and only goes to one place: you type it in at the keyboard and its results are displayed in the console. But what if you want to read information from a file on your computer, and/or write that information to another file?

This process is called file I/O (the “I/O” stands for “input/output”), and Python has a number of built-in functions that handle this for you.

Check out the code in the editor to the right.
##### problem

Click Run! You just wrote all the contents of my_list to a text file called output.txt.
##### solve
```python
my_list = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]
# Generates a list of squares of the numbers 1 - 10

f = open("output.txt", "w")

for item in my_list:
  f.write(str(item) + "\n")

f.close()
```
### The open Function
```python
Let’s walk through the process of writing to a file one step at a time.

The first code that you saw executed in the previous exercise was this:

f = open("output.txt", "w")
This told Python to open output.txt in "w" mode (“w” stands for “write”). We stored the result of this operation in a file object, f.

Doing this opens the file in write-mode and prepares Python to send data into the file.
```
##### problem
Create a variable, my_file, and set it equal to calling the open() function on output.txt. In this case, pass "r+" as a second argument to the function so the file will allow you to read and write to it! (See the Hint for details.)
##### solve
```python
my_file = open("output.txt", "r+")
hint:
You can open files in any of the following modes:

write-only mode ("w")
read-only mode ("r")
read and write mode ("r+")
append mode ("a"), which adds any new data you write to the file to the end of the file.
```
### Writing
```python
Good work! Now it’s time to write some data to a new .txt file.

We added the list comprehension from the first exercise to the code in the editor. Our goal in this exercise will be to write each element of that list to a file called output.txt. The output.txt file that you write to will be created in your current folder - for simplicity, the folder has been hidden. output.txt will list each number on its own line.

We can write to a Python file like so:

my_file.write("Data to be written")
The .write() method takes a string argument, so we’ll need to do a few things here:

You must close the file. You do this simply by calling my_file.close() (we did this for you in the last exercise). If you don’t close your file, Python won’t write to it properly. From here on out, you gotta close your files!
```
##### problem

Iterate over my_list to get each value.

Use my_file.write() to write each value to a text file called, output.txt.

Make sure to call str() on the iterating data so .write() will accept it.

Make sure to add a newline (+ "\n") after each element to ensure each will appear on its own line.

Use my_file.close() to close the file when you’re done.

Passing the exercise means that you successfully wrote my_list to output.txt!
##### solve
```python
my_list = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]

my_file = open("output.txt", "w")

# Add your code below!
for value in my_list:
  my_file.write(str(value) + "\n")
  
my_file.close()
```
### Reading

Excellent! You’re a pro.

Finally, we want to know how to read from our output.txt file. As you might expect, we do this with the read() function, like so:

print my_file.read()
##### problem

Declare a variable, my_file, and set it equal to the file object returned by calling open() with both "output.txt" and "r".

Next, print the result of using .read() on my_file, like the example above.

Make sure to .close() your file when you’re done with it! All kinds of doom will happen if you don’t.
##### solve
```python
my_file = open("output.txt", "r")
print my_file.read()
my_file.close()
```
### Reading Between the Lines

What if we want to read from a file line by line, rather than pulling the entire file in at once. Thankfully, Python includes a .readline() method that does exactly that.

If you open a file and call .readline() on the file object, you’ll get the first line of the file; subsequent calls to .readline() will return successive lines.
##### problem
Declare a new variable my_file and store the result of calling open() on the "text.txt" file in "r"ead-only mode.

On three separate lines, print out the result of calling my_file.readline(). See how it gets the next line each time?

Don’t forget to .close() your file when you’re done with it!
##### solve
```python
my_file = open("text.txt", "r")
print my_file.readline()
print my_file.readline()
print my_file.readline()
my_file.close()
 
when run:
I'm the first line of the file!

I'm the second line.

Third line here, boss.
```
### Buffering Data

We keep telling you that you always need to close your files after you’re done writing to them. Here’s why!

During the I/O process, data is buffered: this means that it is held in a temporary location before being written to the file.

Python doesn’t flush the buffer—that is, write data to the file—until it’s sure you’re done writing. One way to do this is to close the file. If you write to a file without closing, the data won’t make it to the target file.
##### problem
Check out our extremely bad code in the editor. Click Run—you’ll note that our read_file.read() didn’t read any data back!

Add a write_file.close() call after writing to the file but before reading it.
Add a read_file.close() call after the print read_file.read() line
Run the code again.
This time, you’ll see the data come through!
##### solve
```python
# Use a file handler to open a file for writing
write_file = open("text.txt", "w")

# Open the file for reading
read_file = open("text.txt", "r")

# Write to the file
write_file.write("Not closing files is VERY BAD.")
write_file.close()


# Try to read from the file
print read_file.read()
read_file.close()
```
### The with and as Keywords
```python
Programming is all about getting the computer to do the work. Is there a way to get Python to automatically close our files for us?

Of course there is. This is Python.

You may not know this, but file objects contain a special pair of built-in methods: __enter__() and __exit__(). The details aren’t important, but what is important is that when a file object’s __exit__() method is invoked, it automatically closes the file. How do we invoke this method? With with and as.

The syntax looks like this:

with open("file", "mode") as variable:
  # Read or write to the file
  ```
  ##### problem
  Check out the example in the editor. Note that we don’t explicitly close() our file, and remember that if we don’t close a file, our data will get stuck in the buffer. Click Run!

Success! is written to a file called text.txt.
##### solve
```python
with open("text.txt", "w") as textfile:
  textfile.write("Success!")
```
##### problem
Now you try: write any data you like to a file called text.txt using with…as. Give your file object the usual name: my_file.
##### solve
```python
with open("text.txt", "w") as my_file:
  my_file.write("My Data!")
  ```
### Case Closed
```python
Finally, we’ll want a way to test whether a file we’ve opened is closed. Sometimes we’ll have a lot of file objects open, and if we’re not careful, they won’t all be closed. How can we test this?

f = open("bg.txt")
f.closed
# False
f.close()
f.closed
# True
Python file objects have a closed attribute which is True when the file is closed and False otherwise.

By checking file_object.closed, we’ll know whether our file is closed and can call close() on it if it’s still open.
```
###### problem
Below your with…as code, do two things:

Check if the file is not closed.
If that’s the case, call .close() on it.
(You don’t need an else here, since your if statement should do nothing if closed is True.)
After your if statement, print out the value of my_file.closed to make sure your file is really closed.
##### solve
```python
with open("text.txt", "w") as my_file:
  my_file.write("My Data!")
  
if not file.closed:
  file.close()

print my_file.closed
```
